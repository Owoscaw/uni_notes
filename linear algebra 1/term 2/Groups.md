A groups is a set, $G$, with an operation $\cdot:G\times G\mapsto G$ such that the following axioms hold:
# Axioms:

If $x,y\in G$, then $x \cdot y\in G$ (closure)

$(x \cdot y)\cdot z=x \cdot(y \cdot z)$ (associativity)

$G$ contains an identity element $e\in G$ such that $e \cdot x=x \cdot e=x$ for all $x\in G$ (identity)

Each $x\in G$ has an inverse element $x^{-1}\in G$ such that $x \cdot c^{-1}=x^{-1}\cdot x=e$ (inverses)

We also call a group abelian if $x \cdot y= y \cdot x$ for all $x,y\in G$. Note that both $(\Re,+)$ and $(\Re\setminus\{0\},\times)$ are both abelian with identity elements $0$ and $1$ respectively. We propose that $e$ is unique for each group. Say that $e_1,e_2$ are both identities of $G$, therefore $e_1\cdot e_2=e_1$ and $e_1\cdot e_2=e_2$, therefore $e_1=e_2$, every identity element is unique for their respective group. Note that $(M_n(\Re),\times)$ is not an abelian group, since not every matrix has an inverse, but $(M_n(\Re),+)$ is.
