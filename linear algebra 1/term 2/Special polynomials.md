Let $\Re[x]$ denote the infinite dimensional [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] of all real polynomials in $x$, and $\Re[x]_n$ the $n+1$ dimensional vector space of all real polynomials in $x$ of degree at most $n$, we take the [[Inner product spaces|inner product]] to be:$$\Huge (f,g)=\int_a^bf(x)g(x)k(x)dx$$Where $k$ is some fixed continuous function such that $k(x)>0$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ this was proven in the case using [[Polynomial expansions and Self-Adjoint operators|Legendre's equation]]. When considering Legendre's equation, given by:$$\Huge (1-x^2)\frac{d^2}{d^2x}y(x)-2x \frac{d}{dx}y(x)=\lambda y(x)$$Here, the [[Linear Differential Equations#Differential Operators|differential operator]] $\mathcal{L}_L=(1-x^2)\frac{d^2}{dx^2}-2x \frac{d}{dx}$ represents Legendre's equation can it can be written that:$$\Huge \mathcal{L_L}y(x)=\lambda y(x)$$Here, $\mathcal{L}_L:V\mapsto V$. If $V$ is the space of polynomials, the values of $\lambda$ will be [[Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Diagonalisation#Eigenspaces|eigenvalues]] of $\mathcal{L}_L$ acting on $V$.
