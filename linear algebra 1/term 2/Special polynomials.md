# Orthogonal polynomials:

Let $\Re[x]$ denote the infinite dimensional [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] of all real polynomials in $x$, and $\Re[x]_n$ the $n+1$ dimensional vector space of all real polynomials in $x$ of degree at most $n$, we take the [[Inner product spaces|inner product]] to be:$$\Huge (f,g)=\int_a^bf(x)g(x)k(x)dx$$Where $k$ is some fixed continuous function such that $k(x)>0$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ this was proven in the case using [[Polynomial expansions and Self-Adjoint operators|Legendre's equation]].
