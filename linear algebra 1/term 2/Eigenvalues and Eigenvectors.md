Let $T:\Re^n\mapsto\Re^n$ be a [[Linear Maps#Properties of linear maps|linear mapping]] from [[Real vector spaces|$\Re^n$]] to $\Re^n$. $T$ is represented as an $n\times n$ [[Matrix definition|matrix]] $M$. The form of $M$ depends on the [[Bases and dimensions in RN|basis]], and changes under a change of basis. Suppose $\underline x\in\Re^n$ is given wrt the [[Vector space definitions#Zero vector and Standard Basis vectors|standard basis]] as $x_1\underline e_1+\dots+x_n\underline e_n$ and that $M$ is the matrix representing $T$ in this basis:$$\Huge T(\underline x)=M\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}$$If $\{\underline v_1,\dots,\underline v_n\}$ is a different basis, then $\underline x=\tilde x_1\underline v_1+\dots+\tilde x_n\underline v_n$. That is to say:$$\Huge \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}=P\begin{pmatrix}\tilde x_1\\\vdots\\\tilde x_n\end{pmatrix}$$Then the matrix $N$ representing the same linear map $T$ wrt the second basis is given by:$$\Huge T(\underline x)=N\begin{pmatrix}\tilde x_1\\\vdots\\\tilde x_n\end{pmatrix}\implies N=P^{-1}MP$$Loosely speaking, $P^{-1}$ changes the tilda'd coordinates to normal coordinates, $M$ changes according to the linear map, then $P$ changes the normal coordinates to the tilda'd coordinates. This is useful in, for example, the predator prey model where the population of a predator and prey after $n$ years, $\underline v_n$ is in the form $\underline v_n=M^nv_0$ where $M$ represents the change in population year on year and $v_0$ is the initial population. If $M$ were diagonal, then it is trivial to say that:$$\Huge M=\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&b\end{pmatrix}\implies M^n=\begin{pmatrix}a^n&0\\0&b^n\end{pmatrix}$$ To do this, it is crucial to diagonalise $M$.

A non-zero vector $v$ is an eigenvector of a matrix $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda\in\mathbb C$ if:$$\Huge A\underline v=\lambda\underline v\implies(A-I\lambda)\underline v=\underline 0$$If $v$ is an eigenvector, so is $\mu\underline v$ with the same eigenvalue $\lambda$ for any $\mu\neq0$. Since we require $\underline v\neq0$, then $$
