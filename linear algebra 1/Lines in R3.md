Similar to [[Planes in R3|planes]] in $\Re^3$, lines can be described in many ways.

# Parametric:

If $L\in\Re^3$ is a line, it can be described by the set of points:
$$\Huge L=\left\{\underline a+\lambda\underline d:\lambda\in\Re\right\}$$
Where $\underline a\in L$, and $\underline d\neq\underline 0$ is a vector parallel to $L$.
