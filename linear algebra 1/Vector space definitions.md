$\Re^n$ represents the vector space of all column vectors such that:
$$\Large \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix},x_i\in\Re\,,n\geq1$$
Represented as a set:
$$\Huge \Re^n=\left\{\underline x=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}:x_i\in\Re\,\,for\,\,i=1,\dots,n\right\}$$
# Zero vector and Standard Basis vectors:

The Zero vector is defined as a vector who's elements are all zero for however many dimensions it is defined for:
$$\Huge \underline 0=\begin{pmatrix}0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}\in\Re^n$$
Standard basis vectors are defined such that all of their elements are zero except for one, which is one. The position of the one determines which standard basis vector it is for the defined number of dimensions ($n$):
$$\Large For\,\,1\leq i\leq n\,,\underline e_i\in\Re^n:$$
$$\large \underline e_1=\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix},\dots,\underline e_i=\begin{pmatrix}0\\\vdots\\0\\1\\0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix},\dots,\underline e_n=\begin{pmatrix}0\\\vdots\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}$$
Every vector in $\Re^n$ can be represented by a summation of standard basis vectors that have undergone [[Vector addition and multiplication#Scalar multiplication|scalar multiplication]] by each element in said vector:
$$\huge \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}=x_1\,\underline e_1+x_2\,\underline e_2+\dots+x_n\,\underline e_n=\sum^n_{i=1}x_i\,\underline e_i$$
