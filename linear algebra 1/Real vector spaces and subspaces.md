A real [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] is a non-empty set $V$ with two operations:
> Addition:$$\Huge V\times V\mapsto V$$
> Scalar multiplication:$$\Huge \Re\times V\mapsto V$$

These operations must further satisfy the axioms of a real vector space:

# Axioms:

The existence of the additive identity, there is a vector $0$ in $V$ such that for all $v\in V$, $v+0=0+v=v$.

Commutativity, $v+w$
