A real [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] is a non-empty set $V$ with two operations:
> Addition:$$\Huge V\times V\mapsto V$$
> Scalar multiplication:$$\Huge \Re\times V\mapsto V$$

These operations must further satisfy the axioms of a real vector space. Any vector [[Subspaces|subspace]] of $\Re^n$, including $\Re^n$ itself, is also a vector space. The set of all $m\times n$ matrices, $M_{m\times n}(\Re)$ is a vector space. All [[Functions, Domain and Range|functions]] are vector spaces, as we have for a function $f:\Re\mapsto\Re$:$$\Huge (f+g)(t):=f(t)+g(t),\,$$

# Axioms:

The following axioms are associated with the addition function:
>The existence of the additive identity, there is a vector $0$ in $V$ such that for all $v\in V$, $v+0=0+v=v$.
>Commutativity, $v+w=w+v$ for all $v,w\in V$.
>The existence of additive inverses, for every $v\in V$ there exists $-v$ such that $v+(-v)=0=(-v)+v$.
>Associativity, $u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w$ for all $u,v,w\in V$

The following axioms are associated with the scalar multiplication function:
> $0v=0$ for all $v\in V$
> $1v=v$ for all $v\in V$
> Associativity, $(\lambda\mu)v=\lambda(\mu v)$ for all $v\in V$, $\lambda,\mu\in\Re$
> Distributivity, For all $\lambda,\mu\in\Re$ and $v,w\in V$ we have $(\lambda+\mu)v=\lambda v+\mu v$ and $\lambda(v+w)=\lambda v+\lambda w$
