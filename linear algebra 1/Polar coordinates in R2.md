$\Re^2$ is the [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] defined by two dimensions, commonly known as the cartesian plane.

Let $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ be a vector in the cartesian plane, that is $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}\in\Re^2$. This can be represented by saying $x=a$ and $y=b$.
# Magnitude:

For all vectors in the vector space, $\Re^n$, the length or magnitude of a vector is defined by its distance to the origin;
$$\large |\underline v|=\sqrt{(v_1-0)^2+(v_2-0)^2+\dots+(v_n-0)^2}=\sqrt{v_1^2+\dots+v_n^2}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(v_i)}$$
