# Addition:

Matrix addition is a function that takes two $m\times n$ [[Matrix definition|matrices]], and outputs a third matrix with the same dimensions:
$$\Huge +:M_{m\times n}(\Re)\times M_{m\times n}(\Re)\mapsto M_{m\times n}(\Re)$$
$$\Huge (X,Y)\mapsto X+Y$$
This is defined by:
$$\Huge X+Y=(x_{i,j})+(y_{i,j})=(x_{i,j}+y_{i,j})$$
This is component-wise addition of each element in $X$ and $Y$. This is well defined if both matrices have the same dimensions. Addition is not defined when each matric has different dimension.

# Scalar multiplication:

Scalar multiplication is a function that takes a scalar and a matrix, and outputs a matrix of same dimension:
$$\Huge \cdot:\Re\times M_{m\times n}(\Re)\mapsto M_{m\times n}(\Re)$$
$$\Huge (\lambda, A)\mapsto \lambda A$$
This is similarly defined as:$$\Huge (\lambda A)_{i,j}=\lambda A_{i.j},\,\,\forall 1\leq i\leq m,\,1\leq j\leq n$$
