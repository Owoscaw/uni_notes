Informally, a graph consists of a set of vertices, joined by edges. A finite undirected graph is a triple $(V,E,\Phi)$ where $V$ and $E$ are finite sets and $\Phi:E\mapsto V$. $\Phi$ is the incidence function. An edge $e$ is incident to a vertex $v\in V$ if $v\in\Phi(e)$. The two vertices on the edge are the endpoints of the edge. For example, the edge $ab$ is defined as $\Phi(ab)=\{a,b\}$. When the map $\Phi$ is [[Functions, Domain and Range#Injectivity|injective]], the associated graph is called simple. Simple graphs can still be defined by the pair $(E,V)$ where $E\subset V$ and the incidence function is replaced instead by the adjacency relation.

Two vertices, $u,v\in V$ are said to be adjacent in the graph $G=(E,V)$ if $\{u,v\}\in E$. The graph $G=(E,V,\Phi)$ with $V=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$ and $E=\{e_1,\dots,e_m\}$ using the incidence [[Matrix definition|matrix]] $(B(i,j), i\leq n, j\leq m)$ where:$$\Huge B=\begin{cases}$$
