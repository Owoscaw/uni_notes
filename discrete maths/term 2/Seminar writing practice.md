We saw in seminar worksheet 2 that the number of labelled trees with $n$ vertices is given by Cayley's formula:$$\Huge \text{There are }n^{n-2}\text{ distinct labelled trees with }n\text{ vertices}$$However the reasoning given was not particularly rigorous, so we attempt to prove this using linear algebra. Kirchoff proved the Matrix Tree Theorem, which determines the number of spanning trees of a graph. From the worksheet, for simple graphs this states: Given a simple labelled graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertices $V=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$, define the matrix $M=(m)_{ij}$:$$\Huge (m)_{ij}=\begin{cases}-1&\text{if }v_iv_j\in E\\0&\text{if }v_iv_j\notin E\\d_G(v_i)&\text{if }i=j\end{cases}$$Then the number of spanning trees of $G$ is any cofactor of $M$. We want to find the number of spanning trees with $n$ vertices, so applying this result to the complete graph $K_n$ will prove our result. So we construct $M$. Note that the degree of any vertex is $n-1$, and $v_iv_j$ is always an edge:$$\Huge M=\begin{pmatrix}n-1&-1&\dots&-1\\-1&n-1&\dots&-1\\\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\-1&-1&\dots&n-1\end{pmatrix}$$Notice that for an undirected graph, this matrix is always symmetric. We will find the cofactor at $M_{11}$ for convenience, since $i+j=2$, making the cofactor:$$\Huge C_{11}(M)=(-1)^{1+1}\det(M_{(1,1)})$$Where $M_{(1,1)}$ is the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and column of $M$. This will be an $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ matrix. I will note $M_{(1,1)}$ as $M_1$, then if I were to delete the first row and first column from $M_1$, I would call this $M_2$ and so forth, that is $M_{n-1}=(((M_{(1,1)})_{1,1})\dots)_{(1,1)}=(n-1)=n-1$. Since this operation removes a dimension of $M$, this can only be done $n-1$ times to get the $nn$th element of $M$. So we calculate $\det(M_{(1,1)})$:$$ \det(M_{(1,1)})=\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}m_{1j}(-1)^{1+j}\det((M_{(1,1)})_{(1,j)})=(n-1)\det(M_2)+\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}m_{1j}(-1)^{1+j}\det((M_{(1,1)})_{(1,j)})$$$$\small\det(M_{(1,1)})=(n-1)\det(M_2)+\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}(-1)(-1)^{1+j}\det((M_{(1,1)})_{1,j})=(n-1)\det(M_2)+\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}(-1)^j\det((M_{(1,1)})_{1,j})$$
