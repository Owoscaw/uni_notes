We saw in seminar worksheet 2 that the number of labelled trees with $n$ vertices is given by Cayley's formula:$$\Huge \text{There are }n^{n-2}\text{ distinct labelled trees with }n\text{ vertices}$$However the reasoning given was not particularly rigorous, so we attempt to prove this using linear algebra. Kirchoff proved the Matrix Tree Theorem, which determines the number of spanning trees of a graph. From the worksheet, for simple graphs this states: Given a simple labelled graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertices $V=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$, define the matrix $M=(m)_{ij}$:$$\Huge (m)_{ij}=\begin{cases}-1&\text{if }v_iv_j\in E\\0&\text{if }v_iv_j\notin E\\d_G(v_i)&\text{if }i=j\end{cases}$$
