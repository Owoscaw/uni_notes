A tree is a [[Eulerian Graphs#Connectedness|connected]] acyclic graph, that is a connected graph with no cycles present. A forest is any acyclic graph, note that every connected component of a forest is itself a tree. A leaf of a graph is a vertex of degree one. We try drawing all trees of $n$ vertices:![[size n trees]]| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

# Counting trees:

A labelled tree on $n$ vertices is a tree where every vertex on the tree is assigned a unique integer from $1,\dots,n$, labelled trees for $n=2,3,4$:![[labelled trees]]
