A tree is a [[Eulerian Graphs#Connectedness|connected]] acyclic graph, that is a connected graph with no cycles present. A forest is any acyclic graph, note that every connected component of a forest is itself a tree. A leaf of a graph is a vertex of degree one. We try drawing all trees of $n$ vertices:![[size n trees]]

# Counting trees:

A labelled tree on $n$ vertices is a tree where every vertex on the tree is assigned a unique integer from $1,\dots,n$, labelled trees for $n=2,3,4$:![[labelled trees]]$n=5$ was calculated by finding the number of ways to label the 3 types of trees with $5$ vertices seen above.

## Trees to sequences:
Given a tree $T$ with vertices labelled $1,2,\dots,n$ for $n\geq3$, construct a sequence of
