## Stairs example:

A student has a flight of $n$ stairs to climb, and can either climb $1$ or $2$ stairs at a time, how many distinct ways are there to climb $n$ stairs? Call the solution $f_n$. It is obvious to set $f_0=1$, and it follows that the sum of elements in $f_n$ must equal $n$.

Considering $f_n$, taking $1$ step from $f_{n-1}$ will lead to $f_n$. Similarly, taking $2$ steps from $f_{n-2}$ will lead to $f_n$,. These two sets will be disjoint, so it can be argued that:$$\Huge f_n=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}$$
It also makes sense to define $f_1=1$, as there is one way to traverse to step one. This gives all the conditions to find $f_2$, which then allows for $f_3$, e.c.t. Try substituting $f_n=cx^n$ as a solution:$$\Huge cx^n=cx^{n-1}+cx^{n-2}\implies cx^{n-2}(x^2-x-1)=0$$
This equation has four possible solutions, $c=0$ and $x=0$ are trivial, so we look at the quadratic that will yield two solutions $x^2-x-1=0$. This is the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation. Letting the roots of these equations be $\alpha,\beta$. Then $f_n=\alpha^n$ and $f_n=\beta^n$ are valid solutions to the equation, we also get the linear combination $f_n=c_1\alpha^n+c_2\beta^n$ as a valid solution.
