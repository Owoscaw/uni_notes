# Arrangements with repetitions:

Given a list of $n$ objects of $r$ different types, in which objects of type $i$ occur $n_i$ times ($n_1+n_2+\dots+n_r=n$), the number of [[Arrangements and Permutations#Arrangements|arrangements]] of the list is:
$$\Huge P(n,n_1,n_2,\dots,n_r)=\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_r!}$$
