Generating functions encode combinatorial information in an analytical form. For example, the binomial theorem encodes counting information:$$\Huge {n\choose0},{n\choose1},\dots,{n\choose n}\mapsto(1+x)^n$$

Let $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots$ be a sequence of numbers. The ordinary generating function for the sequence is the formal sum:$$\Huge f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k$$
Since this is discrete mathematics, we do not care if this series converges and can manipulate it however we need to, this is why it is called a formal sum.
