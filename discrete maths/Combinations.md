A combination from a set of objects is an unordered selection of elements in that set. For example, $\left\{\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots,\omega_n\right\}$ and $\left\{\omega_n,\omega_{n-1},\dots,\omega_1\right\}$ are different arrangements but the same combination, order does not matter.

A combination on a set $S$ is identified by the multiplicities $m_i,\forall i\in S$, where $m_i$ determines the number of times $i$ appears in $S$.
