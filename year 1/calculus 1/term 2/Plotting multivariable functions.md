For a function of one variable, it is trivial to plot:![[function of single variable example]]This curve has been defined parametrically with $x$ as the parameter. Functions can also be defined implicitly in the form $g(x,y)=0$:$$\Huge C=\{(x,y):g(x,y)=0\}$$This defines the curve as the set of points where the function is satisfied. $x^2+y^2-1=0$ is a good example.

# Functions of two variables:

A function of two variables, $z=f(x,y)$ can be plotted as a surface embedded in three dimensions. Similar to two dimensions, functions can be defined explicitly in the example $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$.

# Functions of $n$ variables:

A function of $n$ variables can be defined as $x_{n+1}=f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$, an $n$-dimensional embedded in $\Re^{n+1}$. This is also defined parametrically:$$\Huge (x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n,x_{n+1})=(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n,f(x_1,\dots,x_n))$$
Functions of two variables can also be represented in the $xy$ plane with a contour plot.
