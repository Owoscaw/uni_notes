$\Re^2$ is the [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] defined by two dimensions, commonly known as the cartesian plane.

Let $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ be a vector in the cartesian plane, that is $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}\in\Re^2$. This can be represented by saying $x=a$ and $y=b$.
# Magnitude:

For all vectors in the vector space, $\Re^n$, the length or magnitude of a vector is defined by its distance to the origin;
$$\large |\underline v|=\sqrt{(v_1-0)^2+(v_2-0)^2+\dots+(v_n-0)^2}=\sqrt{v_1^2+\dots+v_n^2}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(v_i)^2}$$
This sum is defined to be the [[Scalar Product|scalar product]] of the vector $\underline v$ with itself. That is:
$$\Huge |\underline v|:=\sqrt{\underline v\cdot\underline v}\,,\,\,\forall\underline v\in\Re^n$$

# Argument:

The argument of a vector, $\underline v$, in the vector space $\Re^2$ is defined as the angle it makes with the positive $x$ axis. This angle is measured in radians and lies on the interval $\theta\in[0,2\pi)$.

# Polar coordinate system:

Instead of writing a coordinate as $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$, it can be written in terms of its distance to the origin (magnitude) and the angle it makes with the positive $x$ axis (argument). Let $r$ represent the argument of a vector in $\Re^2$, $\underline v$, and $\theta$ its argument. It follows that:
$$\Huge \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}r\,cos\theta\\r\,sin\theta\end{pmatrix},\,r\in(0,\infty),\theta\in[0,2\pi)$$
Where:
$$\Huge |\underline v|=r=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=\left\lvert\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}\right\rvert,\,\,\forall\underline v\in\Re^2$$
The polar coordinates of $\underline v$ would be $(r,\theta)$.
