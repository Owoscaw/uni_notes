Suppose a finite [[Sample spaces and events|sample space]], $\Omega$. In classical probability, each outcome is equally likely and so the sample space $\Omega=\{\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots,\omega_m\}$ can be modelled as:
$$\Huge \mathbb{P}(\{\omega\})=\frac{1}{|\Omega|},\,\,\forall\omega\in\Omega$$
[[Probability definition#Axioms|Axioms of probability]] then determine for any event $A\subseteq\Omega$:
$$\Huge \mathbb{P}(A)=\sum_{\omega\in A}\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\})=\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$$
In the case of a finite state space, the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ can be taken to be the whole superset of $\Omega$, $2^{\Omega}$, as each subset can be assigned a probability while satisfying all axioms.
