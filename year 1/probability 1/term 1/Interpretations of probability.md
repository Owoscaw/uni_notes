The framework of probability outlined by the [[Probability definition#Axioms|axioms of probability]] is far removed from the interpretation of probability. [[Classical probability]] is one interpretation of the framework, however is very limited in practice as it is rare for events to be equally likely.

# Relative Frequency:

Suppose $n$ trials of an experiment of known possible outcomes, and that $n_A$ is the number of times event $A$ occurs. The relative frequency of occurrence $A$ is $n_A/n$. As $n$ tends to infinity, we suppose that the ratio $n_A/n$ tends to a limit, known as $A$'s relative frequency.
