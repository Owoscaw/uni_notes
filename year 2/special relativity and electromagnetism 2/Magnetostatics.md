# Ampere's law:

Magnetostatics is the study of time independent fields and currents with vanishing [[Electromagnetism#Charges, currents, and fields|charge density]] $\rho=0$. That is, there is no net charge, which may seem counterintuitive however this is exactly the case in a metal wire where electrons are moving to provide the current and are able to move due to the positive ions in the metal so that the total charge density remains $0$.

As nothing is time dependent we set the first and third [[Electromagnetism#Maxwell's equations|Maxwells equations]] to $0$:$$\Huge \frac{\partial \underline E}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \underline B}{\partial t}=\underline 0$$now with $\rho=0$ it is consistent to set the electric field $\underline E=0$ which solves these equations. The problem then consists of solving the remaining two:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline B&=\underline 0\\
\underline{\nabla}\times\underline B&=\mu_0\underline J
\end{align}$$for a magnetic field $\underline B$ and a given current density $\underline J$ that sources it. The latter equation is known as Ampere's law. Integrating this equation over an open surface $S$ with boundary surface $C=\partial S$ gives:$$\Huge \int_S\underline{\nabla}\times\underline B\cdot\underline{dS}=\mu _0\int_S\underline J\cdot\underline{dS}$$We now apply [[Integral theorems#Stokes' theorem|Stokes' theorem]] to the first integral to convert it into a line integral and recognise that the second integral is the current $I$ that passes through $S$ to get:$$\Huge \oint_C\underline B\cdot d\underline r=\mu_0I$$This is known as the integral form of Amperes law. This relates the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop to the total current passing through any surface that spans said loop. Note that this does not discriminate between the shape of the surface, however there is an implicit choice of orientation of the surface. One must imagine the normal to $S$ facing the screen, and the line integral is then performed anti-clockwise:![[integral of amperes law]]
As an example we will calculate the magnetic field due to an infinitely long straight wire carrying a current $I$. We take the wire to lie along the $z$-axis with current flowing in the $+z$ direction. It is convenient to use [[Curvilinear coordinates|cylindrical]] coordinates $(R,\theta,z)$ where $x=R\cos\theta,y=R\sin\theta$. By symmetry we see that the magnitude of $\underline B$ can only be a function of $R$.
