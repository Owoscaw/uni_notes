# Ampere's law:

Magnetostatics is the study of time independent fields and currents with vanishing [[Electromagnetism#Charges, currents, and fields|charge density]] $\rho=0$. That is, there is no net charge, which may seem counterintuitive however this is exactly the case in a metal wire where electrons are moving to provide the current and are able to move due to the positive ions in the metal so that the total charge density remains $0$.

As nothing is time dependent we set the first and third [[Electromagnetism#Maxwell's equations|Maxwells equations]] to $0$:$$\Huge \frac{\partial \underline E}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \underline B}{\partial t}=\underline 0$$now with $\rho=0$ it is consistent to set the electric field $\underline E=0$ which solves these equations. The problem then consists of solving the remaining two:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline B&=\underline 0\\
\underline{\nabla}\times\underline B&=\mu_0\underline J
\end{align}$$for a magnetic field $\underline B$ and a given current density $\underline J$ that sources it. The latter equation is known as Ampere's law. Integrating this equation over an open surface $S$ with boundary surface $C=\partial S$ gives:$$\Huge \int_S\underline{\nabla}\times\underline B\cdot\underline{dS}=\mu _0\int_S\underline J\cdot\underline{dS}$$We now apply [[Integral theorems#Stokes' theorem|Stokes' theorem]] to the first integral to convert it into a line integral and recognise that the second integral is the current $I$ that passes through $S$ to get:$$\Huge \oint_C\underline B\cdot d\underline r=\mu_0I$$This is known as the integral form of Amperes law. This relates the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop to the total current passing through any surface that spans said loop. Note that this does not discriminate between the shape of the surface, however there is an implicit choice of orientation of the surface. One must imagine the normal to $S$ facing the screen, and the line integral is then performed anti-clockwise:![[integral of amperes law]]
## Parallel wires example:
As an example we will calculate the magnetic field due to an infinitely long straight wire carrying a current $I$. We take the wire to lie along the $z$-axis with current flowing in the $+z$ direction. It is convenient to use [[Curvilinear coordinates|cylindrical]] coordinates $(R,\theta,z)$ where $x=R\cos\theta,y=R\sin\theta$. By symmetry we see that the magnitude of $\underline B$ can only be a function of $R$. Take $S$ to be the disc in the plane $z=0$ with boundary curve of radius $R$. The vector tangent to the disc is given by $\underline e_\theta=(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta,0)=(-y,x,0)/R$, for the line integral to be non-zero we require the magnetic field to have some component in this direction, so we write $\underline B=B\underline e_\theta$. Using this expression with the integral form of Ampere's law:$$\Huge \int_0^{2\pi}B\underline e_\theta\cdot R\underline e_\theta d\theta=2\pi BR=\mu_0I$$And hence:$$\Huge \underline B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi R}\underline e_\theta=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi(x^2+y^2)}(-y,x,0)$$Note that the form of the magnetic field $\underline B=B\underline e_\theta$ automatically makes the field divergence free for any $B$ dependent on only $R$.

We can use the above result to calculate the force between two parallel current-carrying wires. An infinitesimal segment of the wire $d\underline r$ carrying a current $I$ can be identified with a charge $q$ moving with a velocity $\underline v$, so we write $d\underline r=q\underline v$. By the Lorentz force law, the force on this segment due to $\underline B$ is $I\,d\underline r\times\underline B$. The force on a wire lying along a curve $C$ is then:$$\Huge \underline F=I\int_Cd\underline r\times\underline B(\underline r)$$WLOG we let the first wire carry a current $I_1$ and lie along the $z$-axis so that it produces the previously calculated magnetic field with current $I=I_1$. We take the second wire to carry a current $I_2$ and be parallel to the first wire with coordinates $(D,0,z)$ so that $D$ is the distance between the two wires. The force per unit length on the second wire is then:$$\Huge \frac{\underline F}{l}=\frac{I_2}{l}\int_0^l(0,0,dz)\times\frac{I_2\mu_0}{2\pi D^2}(0,D,0)=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi D}(-1,0,0)$$
Note that if the two wires carry a current in the same direction then $I_1I_2>0$ and the force is attractive. On the other hand if the currents flow in different directions then $I_1I_2<0$ and the force is repulsive. In either case the force per unit length is proportional to the magnitude of the product of currents and inversely proportional to the distance between the wires.![[parallel wires]]
# Magnetic vector potential:

Similar to [[Electrostatic scalar potential#Scalar potential|electrostatic scalar potential]], if the magnetic field is not automatically divergence-free by symmetry, the condition $\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline B=\underline 0$ has to be dealt with directly. This term is known as Gauss' magnetic law, analogous to the electric version. The difference between the two is that there is no source term for the magnetic version, allowing no magnetic charges and forbidding the existence of magnetic monopoles. This equation is easy to solve by introducing a magnetic vector potential $\underline A$:$$\Huge \underline B=\underline{\nabla}\times\underline A$$The proof of which is trivial, as the divergence of a curl always vanishes:$$\Huge \underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline B=\underline{\nabla}\cdot(\underline{\nabla}\times\underline A)=\underline 0$$by definition. Substituting this into Ampere's law gives:$$\Huge \underline{\nabla}(\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline A)-\underline{\nabla}^2\underline A=\mu_0\underline J$$
## Gauge transformations:
Suppose that $\underline A$ is transformed to a new vector potential $\underline A'$ given by adding the gradient of any scalar function $\psi$:$$\Huge \underline A'=\underline A+\underline{\nabla}\psi$$Such a transformation is known as a Gauge transformation and will not change the magnetic field:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\underline B'&=\underline{\nabla}\times\underline A'\\
&=\underline{\nabla}\times(A+\underline{\nabla}\psi)\\
&=\underline B+\underline{\nabla}\times\underline{\nabla}\psi=\underline B
\end{align}$$as the curl of any gradient vanishes. The freedom of the Gauge transformation allows the calculation of $\underline A$ to be simplified by taking it to be divergence-free:$$\Huge \underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline A=0$$such a choice is known as the Coulomb Gauge. To prove that this is always possible, assume that it is not and that $\underline A$ always has a non-zero divergence, we can then perform a Gauge transformation to get a divergence free $\underline A'$:$$\Huge \underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline A'=\underline{\nabla}\cdot(\underline A+\underline{\nabla}\psi)=\underline{\nabla}\cdot A+\underline{\nabla}^2\psi=0$$So we then just choose some $\psi$ that solves the Poisson equation:$$\Huge \underline{\nabla}^2\psi=-\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline A$$given that the original vector potential was not in Coulomb Gauge. There is always a solution to the Poisson equation in terms of the [[Green's method|Green's function]], so this is always possible. We now only work in Coulomb Gauge, simplifying the equation for vector potential:$$\Huge \underline{\nabla}^2\underline A=-\mu_0\underline J$$

# Biot-Savart law:

Recall that the Green's function for the Laplacian is given as:$$\Huge G(\underline r,\underline r')=-\frac{1}{4\pi|\underline r-\underline r'|}$$so the formal solution for each three components of the Coulomb gauge vector potential is given:$$\Huge \underline A_i(\underline r)=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\underline J_i(\underline r')}{|\underline r-\underline r'|}dV'$$It can be checked that this is indeed Coulomb gauge by using the fact that currents are localised inside $V$ and $\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline J=0$ by the continuity equation with $\rho=0$. To compute the magnetic field we need to find the curl of the magnetic vector potential:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\left(\underline{\nabla}\times\frac{\underline J(\underline r')}{|\underline r-\underline r'|}\right)_i&=\epsilon_{ijk}\partial_j(J_k(\underline r')|\underline r-\underline r'|^{-1})\\
&=\epsilon_{ijk}J_k(\underline r')\partial_j(|\underline r-\underline r'|^2)^{-1/2}\\
&=-\epsilon_{ijk}J_k(\underline r')(|\underline r-\underline r'|^2)^{-3/2}(x_j-x_j')\\
&=\left(\frac{\underline J(\underline r')\times(\underline r-\underline r')}{|\underline r-\underline r'|^3}\right)_i
\end{align}$$
So we obtain:$$\Huge \underline B(\underline r)=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\underline J(\underline r')\times(\underline r-\underline r')}{|\underline r-\underline r'|^3}dV'$$the magnetic field due to a generalised current density $\underline J$. We now restrict this to the case of a thin wire, with infinitesimal cross section $A$, lying on a curve $C$, carrying a current $I$. In this case we have $\underline J(\underline r')dV'=JAd\underline r'$ where $d\underline r'$ is tangent to $C$, which reduces the above to the line integral:$$\Huge \underline B(\underline r)=\frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\oint_C\frac{(\underline r-\underline r')}{|\underline r-\underline r'|^3}\times d\underline r'$$known as the Biot-Savart Law, which gives the magnetic field due to a wire of any shape.

We can combine this with the expression for the force on a wire due to a magnetic field. This gives a formula for the force on a wire due to a second wire of arbitrary positions and shapes. Let the first wire carry a current $I_1$ and lie on $C_1$, which produces a magnetic field in accordance to the above formula. Let the second wire carry a current $I_2$ and lie on $C_2$. The force on the second wire, $\underline F$, due to the magnetic field of the first wire, $\underline B_1(\underline r)$ is then given:$$\Huge \underline F=I_2\oint_{C_2}\underline B_1(\underline r_2)\times d\underline r_2=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{4\pi}\oint_{C_1}\oint_{C_2}\left(\frac{\underline r_2-\underline r_1}{|\underline r_2-\underline r_1|^3}\times d\underline r_1\right)\times d\underline r_2$$
