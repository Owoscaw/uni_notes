# Ampere's law:

Magnetostatics is the study of time independent fields and currents with vanishing [[Electromagnetism#Charges, currents, and fields|charge density]] $\rho=0$. That is, there is no net charge, which may seem counterintuitive however this is exactly the case in a metal wire where electrons are moving and are able to move due to the positive ions in the metal
