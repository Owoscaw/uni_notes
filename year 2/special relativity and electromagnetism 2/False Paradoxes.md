# Spacetime diagrams:

An event is a point in space at a given time given by $(t,x,y,z)$, a point in spacetime. The worldline of a particle is it trajectory through spacetime $(t,x(t),y(t),z(t))$:![[spacetime diagram]]
Note that no particle can have worldline with $\phi>\pi/4$. This only shows the reference frame $\mathcal{R}$. We can show two reference frames on the same spacetime diagram:![[spacetime frames]]
With $\tan\phi=v/c$. $x'=\gamma(x-vt)$ so we see that $x'=0$ corresponds to $x=vt$. $t'=\gamma\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^2}\right)$ so we see that $t'=0$ corresponds to $ct=\frac{vx}{c}$. This demonstrates that simultaneity is relative.

The lightcone of an event $E$ is the set of all worldlines of photons that pass through $E$:![[lightcones]]
Where the dashed line represents the extension of the lightcone into suppressed dimensions. The event $E$ can only be the cause of events inside or on its future lightcone and can only be the result of events inside or on its past lightcone. Events outside of $E$'s lightcone are called elsewhere or causally independent of $E$.
