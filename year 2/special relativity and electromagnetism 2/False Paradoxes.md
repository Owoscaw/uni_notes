# Spacetime diagrams:

An event is a point in space at a given time given by $(t,x,y,z)$, a point in spacetime. The worldline of a particle is it trajectory through spacetime $(t,x(t),y(t),z(t))$:![[spacetime diagram]]
Note that no particle can have worldline with $\phi>\pi/4$. This only shows the reference frame $\mathcal{R}$. We can show two reference frames on the same spacetime diagram:![[spacetime frames]]
With $\tan\phi=v/c$. $x'=\gamma(x-vt)$ so we see that $x'=0$ corresponds to $x=vt$. $t'=\gamma\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^2}\right)$ so we see that $t'=0$ corresponds to $ct=\frac{vx}{c}$. This demonstrates that simultaneity is relative.

The lightcone of an event $E$ is the set of all worldlines of photons that pass through $E$:![[lightcones]]
Where the dashed line represents the extension of the lightcone into suppressed dimensions. The event $E$ can only be the cause of events inside or on its future lightcone and can only be the result of events inside or on its past lightcone. Events outside of $E$'s lightcone are called elsewhere or causally independent of $E$.

# Twin paradox:

Consider two twins, one of which moves at velocity $v$ until time $T$, when the twin turns around instantaneously and moves back towards the other twin with velocity $v$. The first twin states that the trip took $T_1$, while the other says that the trip took $T_2$. By time dilation $T_1=\gamma T_2>T_2$, the twin that remained stationary has aged more than the other. The other twin calculates by time dilation that $T_2=\gamma T_1>T_1$. This cannot be true, and is explained by arguing that the other twin was not in an inertial rest frame when turning around as this requires acceleration:![[twin paradox]]To the second twin, the time elapsed instantaneously goes from $cT_1$ to $cT_2$.

# Poles and barns:

Two people are carrying a pole of length $2l$ and moving at a velocity such that $\gamma=2$. They run through a barn of length $l$. By [[Lorentz transformations#Time dilation and length contraction|length contraction]] the pole will have length $2l/\gamma$ relative to the barn, so the pole will fit. We ask if to the perspective of the people, if the pole fits. To determine this we draw a spacetime diagram:![[barn]]
