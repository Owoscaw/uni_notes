# Galilean boost:

A reference frame $\mathcal{R}$ is a spatial coordinate system and a time variable, measured at a fixed value of these spatial coordinates. $\mathcal{R}$ is called inertial if it is not accelerating, allowing for Newton's first law to hold. All inertial frames are either all at rest, or all in a uniform translation with respect to each other.

Let $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}'$ be two inertial frames such that $t=t'=0$, their origins coincide and their axes are aligned. If the origin of $\mathcal{R}'$ is moving along the positive $x$-axis with speed $v$ then the coordinates of $\mathcal{R}'$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are related by the formulae from classical mechanics:$$\Huge t'=t,\,\,x'=x-vt,\,\,y'=y,\,\,z'=z$$This is called a standard Galilean transformation or boost along the $x$-axis. "Standard" refers to the simple assumptions made about $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}'$. $\mathcal{R}'$ could have been rotated ($3$ parameters), translated ($3$ parameters), time not synchronised ($1$ parameter), or had any velocity $v$ ($3$ parameters). Therefore a general Galilean transformation contains $10$ parameters. This can be written in [[Matrix definition|matrix]] form as:$$\Huge\begin{pmatrix}t'\\x'\\y'\\z'\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\-v&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}$$In the case described above, $y$ and $z$ are not important, so we can write:$$\Huge \begin{pmatrix}t'\\x'\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\-v&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}=G(v)\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}$$Where $G(v)=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\-v&1\end{pmatrix}$. Note that:$$\Huge (G(v))^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\v&1\end{pmatrix}=G(-v)$$So we can invert this transformation to give:$$\Huge \begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\v&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}t'\\x'\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}t'\\x'+vt'\end{pmatrix}$$This gives the result that from the point of view of an observer in $\mathcal{R}'$, the origin of $\mathcal{R}$ is moving along the negative $x'$ axis with speed $v$. 

Suppose that there is a frame $\mathcal{R}''$ moving at speed $u'$ along the positive $x'$ axis. Using the standard Galilean transformation we have:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}t''\\x''\end{pmatrix}&=G(u')\begin{pmatrix}t'\\x'\end{pmatrix}=G(u')G(v)\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\-u'&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\-v&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\-u'-v&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}\\
&=G(u'+v)\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}=G(u)\begin{pmatrix}t\\x\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}$$Where $u=u'+v$ is the speed at which the frame $\mathcal{R}''$ moves relative to $\mathcal{R}$. This corresponds to the standard velocity addition formula from classical mechanics.

# Lorentz boosts:

Suppose that the speed of light $c$ is measured in frame $\mathcal{R}$ and $c'$ in frame $\mathcal{R}'$, where $v$ is the relative motion between the two frames. By Galilean velocity addition $c=c'+v\neq c'$, which contradicts the fact that she speed of light is measured to be equal in all internal reference frames.

Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields obey:$$\Huge\left(\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\right)\psi=0$$Where the wave speed $c$ is the speed of light. However one can show that under a standard Galilean transformation, the wave equation does not transform to the expected result. This appears to violate the principle of relativity. Einstein's theory of special relativity resolved both dilemma and showed that the Galilean transformation is incorrect and cannot be used to relate $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}'$. Einstein's theory proposed two postulates:
> The principle of relativity (physical laws are the same in all inertial frames)
> The speed of light in a vacuum is the same in all inertial frames

With these assumptions we derive the transformation relating coordinates in $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}'$ that will replace the Galilean transformation. Consider a light source sitting at the origin in $\mathcal{R}$ that emits a pulse of light in all directions at $t=0$. The light then radiates outwards in an expanding sphere of radius $ct$. The equation of this spherical wavefront is given by:$$\Huge c^2t^2-(x^2+y^2+z^2)=0$$As the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames, then in $\mathcal{R}'$ the equations of the same wavefront must be given by:$$\Huge c^2t'^2-(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)=0$$Therefore we require:$$\Huge c^2t^2-(x^2+y^2+z^2)= c^2t'^2-(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)$$We take a general linear transformation of $x,t$ in the following way:$$\Huge t'=\alpha t+\beta x,\,\,x'=\gamma x+\delta t$$As the origin of $\mathcal{R}'$ is moving along the positive $x$-axis with speed $v$ relative to the origin of $\mathcal{R}$ we must have that $x'=0$ corresponds to $x=vt$, giving $\delta=-v\gamma$. The transformation therefore simplifies to:$$\Huge t'=\alpha t+\beta x,\,\,x'=\gamma(x-vt)$$Using these transformations we get:$$\Huge c^2t^2-x^2=c^2(\alpha^2t^2+2\alpha\beta tx+\beta^2x^2)-\gamma^2(x^2-2vtx+v^2t^2)$$Comparing coefficients gives:$$\Huge c^2\alpha^2=c^2+v^2\gamma^2,\,\,x^2\beta^2=\gamma^2-1,\,\,c^2\alpha\beta=-v\gamma^2$$Multiplying the first two equations and comparing coefficients with the square of the third gives:$$\Huge c^4\alpha^2\beta^2=(c^2+v^2\gamma^2)(\gamma^2-1)v^2\gamma^4\implies(c^2-v^2)\gamma^2=c^2$$Which has positive solution:$$\Huge \gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$The positive solution is chosen so that $x$ and $x'$ axes point in the same direction. This expression is called the Lorentz factor. Note that for $v\neq0$ we have $\gamma>1$. Using this result, we find the other constants to be given by:$$\Huge \alpha=\sqrt{1+\frac{\gamma^2v^2}{c^2}}=\gamma,\,\,\beta=-\frac{v\gamma^2}{c^2\alpha}=-\frac{v\gamma}{c^2}$$This is known as the standard Lorentz transformation or Lorentz boost along the $x$-axis.
