# Minkowski space:

Consider two events $A,B$ with spacetime coordinates $(t_A,x_A,y_A,z_A),(t_B,x_B,y_B,z_B)$ respectively. The separation between each coordinate is given by $\Delta t=t_B-t_A,\Delta x=x_B-x_A,\dots$. The invariant interval is then defined as:$$\Huge s(A,B)^2=c^2(\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2-(\Delta y)^2-(\Delta z)^2$$This is similar to the definition of distance, however not in Euclidean space. If $s(A,B)^2=0$, the two events can be connected by the [[False Paradoxes#Spacetime diagrams|worldline]] of a photon:![[lightlike]]In this case, we call the events "light-like" separated. The vector from $A$ to $B$ given by $\underline v=(v^0,v^1,v^2,v^3)$. If $\underline v$ is light-like, it obeys the inner product defined by the invariant interval:$$\Huge |\underline v|^2=\underline v\cdot\underline v=(v^0)^2-(v^1)^2-(v^2)^2-(v^3)^2=s(\underline v,\underline v)=0$$Sometimes this vector is written as $v=(v^0,\underline v)$ where $\underline v$ is the regular Euclidean $3$-vector:$$\Huge s(v,v)=v\cdot v=(v^0)^2-\underline v\cdot\underline  v$$With the regular [[Inner product spaces|inner product]] in $\Re^3$.

We can now define the Minkowski space as the four dimensional space [[Topological spaces|topologically]] identical to $\Re^4$. The Minkowski space is however not metrically similar to $\Re^4$ as we use the inner product defined above. This forms an [[Inner product spaces|inner product space]] with the inner product defined above.

More generally for $v=(v^0,\underline v)$ and $w=(w^0,\underline w)$ the inner product between the two is:$$\Huge v\cdot w=v^0\cdot w^0-\underline w\cdot\underline v=v^0w^0-\sum_{i=1}^3v^iw^i$$
For a light-like vector $v$, we call it future pointing if $v^0>0$ and past pointing if $v^0<0$.

If $s^2(A,B)>0$ then we call $A$ and $B$ time-like separated, in which case $B$ is inside the [[False Paradoxes#Spacetime diagrams|lightcone]] of $A$. Similarly if $s^2(A,B)<0$ then we call $A$ and $B$ space-like separated, in which case $B$ is outside the lightcone of $A$:![[Spacetime and Tensors 2025-01-29 11.53.11.excalidraw]]
We define:$$\Huge \eta=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&-1&0&0\\0&0&-1&0\\0&0&0&-1\end{pmatrix}$$as the Minkowski metric. We can therefore write the scalar product as:$$\Huge V\cdot W=V^\mu\eta_{\mu\nu}W_{\mu}=V^\mu W_\mu$$where we define $W_\mu=\eta_{\mu\nu}W^\nu$. This gives:$$\Huge W_\mu=(W_0,W_1,W_2,W_3)=(W^0,-W^1,-W^2,-W^3)$$where the index that is up is called contravariant, and the down index is called covariant. The entries of $\eta$ are denoted by $\eta^{\mu\nu}$follow:$$\Huge \eta^{\mu\alpha}\eta_{\alpha\nu}=\delta_\nu^\mu$$
# Lorentz group:

Using this index notation, we can write a [[Lorentz transformations#Lorentz boosts|Lorentz transformation]] as:$$\Huge x'^{\mu}=L^\mu_\nu x^\nu$$We must have that the Lorentz transformation preserves the invariant interval:$$\Huge \eta_{\mu\nu}x'^\mu x'^\nu=\eta_{\mu\nu}L_\alpha^\mu x^\alpha L_\beta^\nu x^\beta=\eta_{\mu\nu}L_\alpha^\mu L_\beta^\nu x^\alpha x^\beta=\eta_{\alpha\beta}x^\alpha x^\beta$$hence $L_\nu^\mu$ must satisfy:$$\Huge \eta_{\mu\nu}L_\alpha^\mu L_\beta^\nu=\eta_{\alpha\beta}$$which can be written in matrix form as:$$\Huge L^t\eta L=\eta$$
We have seen that a Lorentz boost in the $x$ direction corresponds to the matrix having form:$$\Huge \left(\begin{array}{cc|cc}\gamma&-\frac{\gamma v}{c}&0&0\\-\frac{\gamma v}{c}&\gamma&0&0\\\hline0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right)$$Note that a spatial rotation alone with $t'=t$ is still a Lorentz transformation with form:$$\Huge L=\left(\begin{array}{c|c@{}}1&\begin{matrix}0&0&0\end{matrix}\\\hline \begin{matrix}0\\0\\0\end{matrix}&M\end{array}\right)$$where $M$ is a $3\times3$ matrix. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $M^tM=I$, which means that $M\in O(3)$, the orthogonal group. The Lorentz group extends this to the full $6$-dimensional group, allowing $4\times 4$ matrices that satisfy the constraint equation to generate a Lorentz transformation. We denote the Lorentz group as $O(3,1)$. The subgroup of this with $\det L=1$ is called the proper Lorentz group, denoted as $SO(3,1)$. Transformations that preserve time direction are called orthochronous, denoted as $SO^+(3,1)$. A proper orthochronous Lorentz boost with velocity $\underline v$, represents by a $3$-component column vector is given by:$$\Huge L=\left(\begin{array}{c|c}\gamma&-\frac{\gamma}{c}\underline v^t\\-\frac{\gamma}{c}\underline v&I+\frac{\gamma-1}{|\underline v|^2}\underline v\underline v^t\end{array}\right)$$
Shifts of spacetime can also be included in the transformation, extending the Lorentz transformation to:$$\Huge x'^\mu=L^\mu_\nu x^\nu+a^\mu$$where the extra parameters $a^\mu$ encode the translation in space and time between the spacetime origin of the two frames. This extended set gives a $10$-dimensional group called the Poincare group.

# Tensors:

The equation $x'^\mu=L_\nu^\mu x^\nu$ defines how components of a contravariant vector transform under a Lorentz transformation. We now aim to show how the components of a covariant vector transform:$$\Huge x'_\mu=\eta_{\mu\alpha}x'^\alpha=\eta_{\mu\alpha}L_\beta^\alpha x^\beta=\eta_{\mu\alpha}L_\beta^\alpha\eta^{\beta\nu}x_\nu=L_\mu^\nu x_\nu$$which is slightly different to the earlier transformation, as the position of the $\mu$ and $\nu$ indices have switched. We can manipulate the constraint equation $\eta_{\mu\nu}L_\alpha^\mu L_\beta^\nu=\eta_{\alpha\beta}$ by lowering an index to get:$$\Huge L_{\nu\alpha}L_\beta^\nu=\eta_{\alpha\beta}$$Now we multiply by $\eta^{\mu\alpha}$ to obtain:$$\Huge \eta^{\mu\alpha}L_{\nu\alpha}L_\beta^\nu=\eta^{\mu\alpha}\eta_{\alpha\beta}\implies L_\nu^\mu L_\beta^\nu=\delta^\mu_\beta$$We can use the definition of the inverse matrix to obtain:$$\Huge (L^{-1})_\nu^\mu L_\beta^\nu=\delta_\beta^\mu\implies L_\nu^\mu=(L^{-1})_\nu^\mu$$

The derivative operator defined as:$$\Huge \partial_\mu=\frac{\partial }{\partial x^\mu}$$is an important example of a covariant vector. We check that it has the correct transformation under $x'^\mu=L_\nu^\mu x^\nu$. By the chain rule we get:$$\Huge \partial_\mu'=\frac{\partial }{\partial x'^\mu}=\frac{\partial x^\alpha}{\partial x'^\mu}\frac{\partial }{\partial x^\alpha}=\frac{\partial x^\alpha}{\partial x'^\mu}\partial_\alpha$$We can invert the transformation by multiplying this with $L_\mu^\alpha$ to get:$$\Huge L_\mu^\alpha x'^\mu=L_\mu^\alpha L_\nu^\mu x^\nu=\delta_\nu^\alpha x^\nu=x^\alpha$$now since $x^\alpha=L_\mu^\alpha x'^\mu$ we have:$$\Huge \frac{\partial x^\alpha}{\partial x'^\mu}=L_\mu^\alpha\implies\partial_\mu'=L_\mu^\alpha\partial_\alpha$$which is consistent with the transformation law of a covariant vector.

A tensor of type $(m,n)$ is an object with $m$ contravariant indices and $n$ covariant indices, that transforms under a Lorentz transformation by the product of the appropriate factors for each index. The rank of the tensor is $m+n$. 

If $V^\mu$ and $W^\mu$ are contravariant tensors then $V^\mu W^\nu$ is a rank $2$ tensor of type $(2,0)$. $V^\mu W_\nu$ is a rank $2$ tensor of type $(1,1)$. $V^\mu\partial_\alpha W_\nu$ is a rank $3$ tensor of type $(1,2)$.

Contraction is the process of taking a tensor of type $(m,n)$ and summing over a contravariant and covariant index to produce a tensor of type $(m-1,n-1)$. The wave operator is an example of this:$$\Huge \partial_\mu\partial^\mu=\partial^2_0-\partial_1^2-\partial_2^2-\partial_3^2$$
