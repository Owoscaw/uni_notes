Suppose that a [[Definitions of Markov Chains|Markov chain]] with [[Definitions of Markov Chains#Stochastic matrices|stochastic matrix]] $P$ is [[Class structure, hitting times, and stopping times#Periodicity|aperiodic]] and irreducible and $\pi$ is an [[Statistical properties of Markov Chains#Invariance|invariant distribution]] for $P$. Then $(X_n)_{n\geq0}$ is $\text{Markov}(\lambda,P)$ and for all $j\in I$:$$\Huge \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}[X_n=j]=\pi_j$$Taking $\lambda=\delta_i$ then this theorem states that $P_{ij}^{(n)}\to\pi_j$. Take the following as example:![[conv to eq example]]
