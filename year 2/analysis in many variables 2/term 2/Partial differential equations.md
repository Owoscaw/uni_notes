A partial differential equation (PDE) involves many variables and their [[Partial derivatives|partial derivatives]]. One such PDE is the heat equation:$$\Huge \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=D\left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}\right)$$This equation describes heat by a scalar function $u(x,y,t)$, the dependent variable. The behavior of the dependent variable is based on the independent variables: $x$, $y$, and $t$. These differ from ordinary [[First order differential equations|differential equations]], as PDEs involve many independent variables. The order of an ODE is the highest order derivative that appears in the equation. A PDE is linear if it is linear in the dependent variable, and nonlinear otherwise.

# Solutions:

A solution to a PDE in some region $R$ of the space of independent variables is a function, $u$, that possesses all the partial derivatives present in the PDE and satisfies said PDE on $R$. Consider the heat equation defined above. There are two spatial variables $x,y$ and one time variable $t$. We assume a square domain where $x,y\in[0,L]$, making $R=[0,L]\times[0,L]\times(0,\infty)$. A solution to this PDE is given:$$\Huge u(x,y,t)=e^{-D\left(\frac{n^2+m^2}{L^2}\right)t}\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\cos\left(\frac{m\pi x}{L}\right)$$With $n,m\in\mathbb{Z}$. All required partial derivatives exist, and the solution can be shown to satisfy the PDE.
