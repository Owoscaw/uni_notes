Consider PDEs of the form:$$\Huge \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=Lu+h(x,t)$$Where $L$ is some [[Differential operators|differential operator]] in $x$. We consider $u(x,t)$ to be a one dimensional scalar model on a domain $x\in[a,b]$ and $t>0$.

We have many degrees of freedom in this model. One such is the operator $L$. The differential operator $L$ must satisfy linearity. That is $L(u_1+u_2)=L(u_1)+L(u_2)$, implying the [[Partial differential equations#Linear equations and superposition|principle of superposition]].
