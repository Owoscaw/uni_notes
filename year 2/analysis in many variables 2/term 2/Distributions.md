In studying [[Green's method#Green's function via delta function|Green's function]] we defined the delta "function" which is, at best, a limit of functions. We saw that it was defined by acting with another function to "sift out" the value at zero:$$\Huge\int_\Re\delta(x)f(x)dx=f(0)$$This can also be defined as:$$\Huge \langle \delta,\phi\rangle=\phi(0)$$where $\delta$ is the delta distribution and $\phi$ is the test function.
