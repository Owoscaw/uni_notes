The gradient of a [[Line integrals#Line integrals of Scalar Fields|scalar field]] $f:\Re^3\mapsto\Re$ is given by the operator:$$\Huge \underline\nabla f|_{\underline x}=\lim_{d(S)\to 0}\frac{1}{|V|}\oint_Sf\cdot \hat{\underline n}\,dS$$Where $S$ is a closed surface around $\underline x$ with outward normal vector $\hat{\underline n}$, enclosed volume $|V|$, and diameter $d(S)$ given by:$$\Huge d(S)=\sup_{\underline x,\underline y\in S}|\underline x- \underline y|$$![[scalar field grad.png]]
Note that $\underline\nabla f$ is a vector field $\Re^3\mapsto\Re^3$ and that $\underline\nabla f$ points in the direction of fastest increase in $f$, $|\underline\nabla f|$ represents how fast $f$ is increasing. To ensure this limit exists, $f$ is assume to have continuous [[Partial derivatives|partial derivatives]], that is $f$ is continuously differentiable, $f\in C^1$.

We propose that in cartesian coordinates, we have:$$\Huge \underline\nabla f=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\underline e_1+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\underline e_2+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\underline e_3$$To prove this, we show the derivation of the $\underline e_1$ component, since the others are analogous. Let $S$ be a small cylinder of radius $\epsilon$, length $h$, and along the $\underline e_1$ axis. We then observe:![[cartesian gradient]]The proof for the other two vectors is similar, replacing $\underline e_1$ with $\underline e_2$ and $\underline e_3$. This uses the MVT for double integrals defined and proven later on in these notes. 

Take the scalar field $f(\underline x)=y+x^2$ for example. Then by the above proposition we have that:$$\Huge \underline\nabla f=2x \underline e_1+\underline e^2$$

## [[EVT, MVT, boundedness and monotonicity#Mean Value Theorem|MVT]] for double integrals:

If a scalar field $f:\Re^3\mapsto\Re^3$ is continuous on a closed, bounded, and connected domain, $A\subseteq\Re^2$ then there exists $\underline x_*$ such that:$$\Huge \int_A fdS=|A|f(\underline x_*)$$Where $|A|$ represents the area of $A$. To prove this, observe that under these specific conditions, we know that $f$ attains a minimum and maximum on $A$ at the points $\underline x_{\text{min}},\underline x_{\text{max}}$. Also:$$\Huge |A|f(\underline x_{\text{min}})\leq\int_A fdS\leq|A|f(\underline x_{\text{max}})$$Now let $\underline x(t)$ be a parametrisation of a curve in $A$ such that $\underline x(t_0)=\underline x_{\text{min}}$ and $\underline x(t_1)=\underline x_{\text{max}}$. Then let $g(t)=|A|f(\underline x(t))$ so we have $g(t_0)=|A|f(\underline x_{\text{min}}),g(t_1)=|A|f(\underline x_{\text{max}})$. We have that $g$ is continuous, therefore by the [[IVT and EVT|IVT]] and the above inequality, there exists $t_*\in[t_0,t_1]$ such that:$$\Huge g(t_*)=\int_AfdS$$Then observe at $\underline x_*=\underline x(t_*)$ we have that:$$\Huge |A|f(\underline x_*)=g(t_*)=\int_SfdS$$So we get the result as required.

# Curvilinear gradients:

In [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear coordinates]] $(u,v,w)$, we have the following:$$\Huge \underline\nabla f=\frac{1}{h_u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\underline e_u+\frac{1}{h_v}\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\underline e_v+\frac{1}{h_w}\frac{\partial f}{\partial w}\underline e_w$$We prove this in a similar manner to the cartesian basis, we look at the $\underline e_u$ component and the rest are analogous:$$\large \underline e_u\cdot\underline\nabla f=\left(\frac{1}{h_u}\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial u}\right)\cdot\underline\nabla f=\frac{1}{h_u}\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\underline e_1+\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\underline e_2+\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\underline e_2\right)\cdot \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\underline e_1+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\underline e_2+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\underline e_3\right)$$Where we have used the cartesian form of $\underline\nabla f$ and expanded $\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial u}$ to each of its components in the cartesian basis. The proof is then as follows:$$\Huge \underline e_u\cdot \underline\nabla  f=\frac{1}{h_u}\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)$$Now notice that the bracketed term is the partial derivative of $f$ wrt $u$, so we write:$$\Huge \underline e_u\cdot\underline\nabla f=\frac{1}{h_u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}$$Giving us the proof as requred.
