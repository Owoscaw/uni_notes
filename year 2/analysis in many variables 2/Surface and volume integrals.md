A two dimensional surface embedded in $\Re^3$ can be defined parametrically as a map $\underline x(u,v)$ from $\Re^2\mapsto\Re^3$ for $u\in[u_0,u_1]$ and $v\in[v_0,v_1]$:![[surface.png]]

For each fixed $u,v$, the position $\underline x(u,v)$ describes a curve with tangent vector $\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial u},\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial v}$. If $\underline x(u,v)$ is a well defined parametrisation then each partial derivative are not collinear, allowing the definition of the unit normal, shown as $\hat{\underline n}$:$$\Huge \hat{\underline n}=\frac{\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial u}\times\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial v}}{\left|\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial u}\times\frac{\partial \underline x}{\partial v}\right|}$$The sign of $\hat{\underline n}$ depends on the ordering of $u,v$. A surface together with a specified choice of $\hat{\underline n}$ is called an oriented surface. Take for example the torus defined by $\underline x(u,v)=(R+\cos v)\cos u\underline e_1+(R+\cos v)\sin u\underline e_2+\sin v\underline e_3$:![[torus example]]
A surface is smooth if $\hat{\underline n}$ varies continuously over the surface. A surface is piecewise smooth if it can be divided into finitely many smooth pieces. For example, the surface defined by $\underline x(r,\theta)=r\cos\theta \underline e_1+r\sin\theta \underline e_2+r \underline e_3$ for $r\in[0,\infty),\theta\in[0,2\pi]$. Notice that $x^2+y^2=z^2\implies z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, this is a cone centred at the origin. It is smooth everywhere except at the origin, since $\hat{\underline n}$ cannot be defined here. This can be shown algebraically by finding the normal vector and noticing that $\hat{\underline n}\propto-x \underline e_1-y \underline e_2+z \underline e_3$, which does not exists at $(0,0,0)$.

A surface is open if it is bounded by a curve, or closed if it has no boundary. An example of a surface with a boundary would be a hemisphere, the dissection would be the boundary. A boundary of a surface $S$ is often written as $\partial S$.
