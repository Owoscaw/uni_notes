# Phase space:

A state of a classical system at some time $t$ is a complete set of data that fully specifies future evolution of the system. The [[Calculus of variations#Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange]] equations are $n$ second order equations in $u$ generalised coordinates. These need $2n$ constants to be fully determined.

Phase space is defined as the set of all possible states for a system at a given time. This is analogous to the definition of [[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|configuration space]], however allowing the inclusion of any relevant information in a state. This results in:$$\Huge \dim(\text{Phase space})=2\dim(\text{Configuration space})$$For example, a particle moving in one dimension can be parametrised with $x(t)$ and $\dot x(t)$. The configuration space is $\{x(t)\}$ whereas phase space is $\{x(t),\dot x(t)\}$. This example can be extended to a particle moving in $\Re^d$, where the phase space would become $\Re^{2d}$.

The Hamiltonian Formalism is the study of dynamics in phase space parametrised by [[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|generalised coordinates]] $\underline q_i$ and their associated [[Lagrangians for classical mechanics#Ignorable coordinates and Conservation of momentum|generalised momenta]] $p_i$. The fundamental step here is to invert the defining relations for $p_i$:$$\Huge p_i=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \underline q_i}(\underline q,\dot{\underline q})\implies \underline{\dot q_i}(\underline q,\underline p)$$Where we solve the equations generated by the LHS to find $\underline{\dot q_i}$ in terms of $\underline q$ and $\underline p$.

The simplest example for this is considering a massive particle moving in $\Re$. Then we have:$$\Huge L=\frac{1}{2}m\dot x^2\implies p=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot x}=m\dot x\implies \dot x=\frac{p}{m}\implies L=\frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m}$$

# Poisson bracket:

Given two functions $f(\underline q,\underline p),g(\underline q,\underline p)$ in phase space, we define the Poisson bracket:$$\Huge \{f,g\}:=\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial p_i}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial q_i}\right)$$Note that $\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p_j}=\frac{\partial p_j}{\partial q_i}=0$, that is $\underline p$ and $\underline q$ are held constant. Taking $f=g=q_1$ we see:$$\Huge\{q_1,q_1\}=\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_i}-\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial q_i}\right)=0$$Since, by definition, $\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_i}=0$. This holds for any two coordinates or two generalised momenta:$$\Huge \{q_i,q_j\}=\{p_i,p_j\}=0$$We can then compute:$$\Huge \{q_i,p_j\}=\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial q_k}\frac{\partial p_j}{\partial p_k}-\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p_k}\frac{\partial p_j}{\partial q_k}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial q_k}\frac{\partial p_j}{\partial p_k}=\delta_{ij}$$
One can prove the following properties of the Poisson bracket:
> $\{f,g\}=-\{g,f\}$, antisymmetric
> $\{\alpha f+\beta h,g\}=\alpha\{f,g\}+\beta\{h,g\}$ and $\{f,\alpha g+\beta h\}=\alpha\{f,g\}+\beta\{f,h\}$ bilinear on both terms
> $\{f,gh\}=\{f,g\}h+\{f,h\}g$, Leibniz identity
> $\{\{f,g\},h\}+\{\{h,f\},g\}+\{\{g,h\},f\}=0$, Jacobi identity
