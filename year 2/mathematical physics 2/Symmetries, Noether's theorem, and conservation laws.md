[[Lagrangians for classical mechanics#Ignorable coordinates and Conservation of momentum|Ignorable coordinates]] motivates the statement that a coordinate $q_i$ is ignorable if the [[Calculus of variations#Euler-Lagrange equations|Lagrangian]] is invariate under the transformation $q_i\mapsto q_i+\epsilon a_i$ with $\epsilon a_i$ an arbitrary constant shift. Whenever this happens, we observed that generalised momentum $p_i$ was conserved.

Consider a uniparametric family of smooth maps $\varphi(\epsilon):\mathcal{C}\mapsto\mathcal{C}$ from [[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|configuration space]] to itself, with the property that $\varphi(0)$ is the identity map. We call this family of maps a transformation depending on $\epsilon$. In any given coordinate system, we can write the transformation as:$$\Huge q_i\rightarrow\phi_i(q_1,\dots,q_N,\epsilon)$$With $\phi_i$ a set of $N:=\dim\mathcal{C}$ functions representing the finite transformation in the given coordinate system. We then take the change in velocities to be:$$\Huge \dot q_i\rightarrow \frac{d}{dt}\phi_i$$
