Consider a system with kinetic energy $T(q,\dot q)$ and potential energy $V(q)$, where $q$ represents the[[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|generalised coordinates]] of the system, then the Lagrangian that leads to the correct physical equations of motion is:$$\Huge L=T-V$$
Let the [[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|configuration space]] be $\Re^3$ and choose cartesian coordinates as the coordinate system, we have:$$\Huge T=\frac{1}{2}m(\dot x_1^2+\dot x_2^2+\dot x_3^2),\,\,V=V(x_1,x_2,x_3)$$We have three degrees of freedom, so expect three Euler-Lagrange equations given by:$$\Huge 0=\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x_i}\right)=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}-m \frac{d}{dt}(\dot x_i)=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}-m\ddot x_i$$Where we have used the fact that $\frac{\partial V}{\partial\dot x_i}=\frac{\partial T}{\partial x_i}=0$, which comes from the fact that $x_i$ and $\dot x_i$ are treated as independent variables. This can be rewritten as:$$\Huge m\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(\underline x)=-\underline\nabla V$$Which is precisely Newton's second law for a conservative force:$$\Huge \underline F=- \underline\nabla V$$
# Simplest example:

A particle of mass $m$ moving freely in $\Re^d$ has a configuration space $\Re^d$. This is a Newtonian system, so the Lagrangian is of the form $L=T-V$.
