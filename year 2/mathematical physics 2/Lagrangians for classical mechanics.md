Consider a system with kinetic energy $T(q,\dot q)$ and potential energy $V(q)$, where $q$ represents the[[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|generalised coordinates]] of the system, then the Lagrangian that leads to the correct physical equations of motion is:$$\Huge L=T-V$$
Let the [[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|configuration space]] be $\Re^3$ and choose cartesian coordinates as the coordinate system, we have:$$\Huge T=\frac{1}{2}m(\dot x_1^2+\dot x_2^2+\dot x_3^2),\,\,V=V(x_1,x_2,x_3)$$We have three degrees of freedom, so expect three Euler-Lagrange equations given by:$$\Huge 0=\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x_i}\right)=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}-m \frac{d}{dt}(\dot x_i)=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}-m\ddot x_i$$Where we have used the fact that $\frac{\partial V}{\partial\dot x_i}=\frac{\partial T}{\partial x_i}=0$, which comes from the fact that $x_i$ and $\dot x_i$ are treated as independent variables. This can be rewritten as:$$\Huge m\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(\underline x)=-\underline\nabla V$$Which is precisely Newton's second law for a conservative force:$$\Huge \underline F=- \underline\nabla V$$
# Simplest example:

A particle of mass $m$ moving freely in $\Re^d$ has a configuration space $\Re^d$. This is a Newtonian system, so the Lagrangian is of the form $L=T-V$. Choose cartesian coordinates to describe the position of the particle, $\underline q=x_1,\dots,x_d$. In these coordinates we have:$$\Huge T=\frac{1}{2}m\sum_{i=1}^d\dot x_i^2=L$$Then by the Euler-Lagrange equations we have:$$\Huge \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x_i}\right)=0\implies(0)-\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}m\ddot x^2\right)=-m\ddot x_i=0$$Assuming $m\neq0$ we have:$$\Huge \ddot x_i=0\,\,\forall i\in\{1,\dots,d\}$$Which can be solved to give the solution:$$\Huge x_i(t)=a_it+b_i\,\,\forall i\in\{1,\dots,d\}$$Where $a_i,b_i\in\Re$ are constants.

# Pendulum example:

A particle of mass $m$ is free to swing from a rod of length $l$ attached to a fixed surface:![[pendulum.png]]
Since $l$ is fixed, we have that $x^2+y^2=l^2\implies(x,y)$ is a constrained coordinate system.
