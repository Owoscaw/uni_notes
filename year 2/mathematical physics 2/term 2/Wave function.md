In quantum mechanics, particles do not have fixed position or generalised momenta. These are assigned according to a complex wave function. The wave function $\psi(x,t)$ is a complex function of position $x$ and time $t$. We define a continuous function:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\psi_t&:\Re\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\\
&:x\mapsto\psi(x,t)
\end{align}$$at each time $t\in\Re$. We also define the probability density as the modulus squared of the wave function:$$\Huge P(x,t):=|\psi(x,t)|^2$$This describes the "probability density" for a measurement at time $t$ to find the particle at position $x$. There are two interpretations of this:
> The probability to find the particle between an infinitesimally small interval $[x, x+dx]$ at time $t$ is $P(x,t)dx$.
> The probability to find the particle in a finite interval $a<x<b$ is:$$\Huge\int_a^bP(x,t)dx$$
