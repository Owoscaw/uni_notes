# Statement of postulates:

>Particles are described by a [[Wave function|wave function]]:$$\Huge \psi(x,t)\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$$for $x$ in some classical [[Calculus of variations#Configuration space and generalised coordinates|configuration space]] with an inner product:$$\Huge \langle \psi,\psi'\rangle=\int_A\overline{\psi(x)}\psi'(x)dx$$where $A$ is the configuration space, such that $\langle \psi,\psi\rangle=1$ is normalised.
>Any classical observable quantity corresponds to some [[Hilbert space#Hermitian operators|Hermitian operator]] that satisfies:$$\Huge \langle \hat A\psi_1,\psi_2\rangle=\langle \psi_1,\hat A\psi_2\rangle$$These operators take a wave function (vector) in [[Hilbert space]] to another wave function in the same space.
>The possible outcomes of a measurement (of an operator $\hat A$) are given by the [[Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Diagonalisation|eigenvalues]] of $\hat A$. How these values are assigned depends on whether the spectrum of eigenvalues is [[Hilbert space#Discrete spectra|discrete]] or [[Hilbert space#Continuous spectra|continuous]].
>If a measurement of $\hat A$ has an outcome $a_n\text{ or }a_k$, the wave function collapses to $\phi_n(x)\text{ or }\phi_k(x)$ for the discrete or continuous case respectively.
>$\psi(x,t)$ evolves according to the [[Schrodinger's equation|Schrodinger equation]]:$$\Huge i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\psi(x,t)=\hat H\psi(x,t)$$

Note that typically, each eigenfunction $\phi_n(x)$ evolves with time.
