We saw how to compute the [[Wave function#Expectation values|average position]] and the spread of a particle. We now aim to do the same for the generalised momenta of the particle. Classically, we saw that a [[Hamiltonian Formalism#Hamiltonian flows|transformation]] with parameter $\epsilon$ generated by a function $A(x,p)$ takes form:$$\Huge\begin{align}
x\rightarrow x'&=x+\epsilon\{x,A\}\\
p\rightarrow p'&=p+\epsilon\{p,A\}
\end{align}$$Where $\{x,A\}$ is the [[Hamiltonian Formalism#Poisson bracket|Poisson bracket]] between $x$ and $A$ given by:$$\Huge \{f,g\}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$$In particular, the transformation generated by taking $A(x,p)=p$ is:$$\Huge\begin{align}
x\rightarrow x'&=x+\epsilon\{x,p\}=x+\epsilon\\
p\rightarrow p'&=p+\epsilon\{p,p\}=p
\end{align}$$So we see that the momentum $p$ generates an infinitesimal translation of $\epsilon$ in the wave function, $\psi(x)\rightarrow\psi(x-\epsilon)$.

# Momentum:

Consider a wave function $\psi(x)$ translated by an infinitesimal amount $\epsilon$ in the positive $x$ direction. We can then find the change in the wave function by [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]]:$$\Huge \delta_\epsilon\psi(x)=\psi(x-\epsilon)-\psi(x)=-\epsilon\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\psi(x)+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$$This suggests that in order for momentum to generate translations, $p$ should be defined in terms of the derivative with respect to $x$. We therefore define the momentum operator:$$\Huge \hat p=-i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x}$$Such that:$$\Huge \delta_\epsilon\psi(x)=-\epsilon\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat p\,\psi(x)$$Where $\hbar$ is some constant of proportionality. Since $p$ has units $MLT^{-1}$ and $\frac{\partial }{\partial x}$ has units $L^{-1}$, $\hbar$ must therefore be in units $ML^2T^{-1}$ or "energy time". Also since the wave function is complex, one could imagine $\hbar$ to be a complex number. However we will show that $\hbar$ has to be real in order to produce real momentum, hence the factor of $-i$ in the definition of the momentum operator. 

$\hbar$ is known as the reduced Planck's constant. In our universe, data suggests that:$$\Huge\hbar\approx1.05\times10^{-34}\text{kg m}^2\text{s}^{-1}$$This is very small, which is why quantum effects are not observed in day to day life.

# Commutation:

Since we defined the momentum operator, we also define the position operator:$$\Huge\hat x=x$$This simply multiplies an expression by position, $x$. The commutator of these operators is then defined as:$$\Huge [\hat x,\hat p]:=\hat x\hat p-\hat p\hat x$$We can apply this operator to the wave function to get:$$\Huge\begin{align}
[\hat x,\hat p]\psi(x)&=\hat x(\hat p\,\psi(x))-\hat p(\hat x\,\psi(x))\\
&=x\left(-i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\psi(x)\right)+i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(x\,\psi(x))\\
&=-i\hbar x\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}+i\hbar x\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}+i\hbar\,\psi(x)\\
&=i\hbar\,\psi(x)
\end{align}$$Since the wave function was general, we can write this result as the equivalence:$$\Huge [\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$$This is known as the canonical commutation relation.

# Momentum expectation:

We saw the [[Wave function#Expectation values|expectation of position]] previously, so we now propose that the expectation of momentum is given by:$$\Huge \langle p\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\overline{\psi(x,t)}\hat p\,\psi(x,t)dx=-i\hbar\int_{-\infty}^\infty\overline{\psi(x,t)}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\psi(x,t)dx$$We require that $\langle p\rangle\in\Re$. Suppose that $\hbar$ is complex, we then compute the conjugate of $\langle p\rangle$:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\overline{\langle p\rangle}&=i\hbar\int_{-\infty}^\infty\psi(x,t)\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\overline{\psi(x,t)}dx\\
&=i\hbar[|\psi(x,t)|^2]_{-\infty}^\infty-i\hbar\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\psi(x,t)\overline{\psi(x,t)}dx\\
&=0-i\hbar\int_{-\infty}^\infty\overline{\psi(x,t)}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\psi(x,t)dx\\
&=\frac{\bar\hbar}{\hbar}\langle p\rangle
\end{align}$$Therefore $\langle p\rangle$ is real if and only if $\hbar$ is real, since in this case $\bar\hbar=\hbar$, making $\overline{\langle p\rangle}=\langle p\rangle$, so $\langle p\rangle$ must therefore be real. Note that we require $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ to vanish at $x\to\pm\infty$ so that it is normalisable. We can also compute more general expectation values for functions of momentum:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\langle f(p)\rangle&=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\overline{\psi(x,t)}f(\hat p)\psi(x,t)dx\\
&=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\overline{\psi(x,t)}f\left(-i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\right)\psi(x,t)dx
\end{align}$$
## Gaussian example:

Consider the [[Wave function#Gaussian wave function|Gaussian wave function]]. We showed that $\langle x\rangle=0$ and $\langle x^2\rangle=\Delta^2$ and therefore $\Delta x=\Delta$. Consider the momentum operator acting on this function:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\hat p\psi(x)&=\frac{i\hbar}{2\Delta^2}x\,\psi(x)\\
\hat p^2\psi(x)&=\frac{\hbar^2}{2\Delta^2}\psi(x)-\frac{\hbar^2}{4\Delta^4}x^2\psi(x)
\end{align}$$Note that these results are simply a polynomial in $x$ multiplied by $\psi(x)$. We can therefore use the results applied to position to get:$$\Huge \langle p\rangle=\frac{i\hbar}{2\Delta^2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty x|\psi(x,t)|^2dx=\frac{i\hbar}{2\Delta^2}\langle x\rangle=0$$And similarly we get:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\langle p^2\rangle&=\frac{\hbar^2}{2\Delta^2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty|\psi(x,t)|^2dx-\frac{\hbar^2}{4\Delta^4}\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2|\psi(x,t)|^2dx\\
&=\frac{\hbar^2}{2\Delta^2}\cdot 1-\frac{\hbar^2}{4\Delta^4}\langle x^2\rangle\\
&=\frac{\hbar^2}{4\Delta^2}
\end{align}$$So we see that $\Delta p=\sqrt{\langle p^2\rangle-\langle p\rangle}^2=\frac{\hbar}{2\Delta}$. Note that the product of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta p$ becomes invariant of $\Delta$:$$\Huge\Delta x\Delta p=\Delta\cdot\frac{\hbar}{2\Delta}=\frac{\hbar}{2}$$This means that an attempt to localise the particle by reducing $\Delta x$ has to result in an increase in $\Delta p$, the momentum uncertainty.

# Energy:

Given the wave function $\psi$ of a particle moving through a potential $V(x)$ we ask how we can determine the possible outcomes of energy measurement and their associated probabilities. To do this we must construct an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of [[Schrodinger's equation#Hamiltonian operator|$\hat H$]]. We therefore assume the following:
> There is a discrete set of eigenvalues.
> There is a unique eigenfunction $\phi_j(x)$ that solves:$$\Huge \hat H\phi_j(x)=E_j\phi_j(x)$$for each eigenvalue $E_j$.

We choose the basis to be orthonormal and expand the wave function over the basis:$$\Huge \psi(x)=\sum_jc_j\phi_j(x)$$which means that the probability to measure $E_j$ is $|c_j|^2$. We can therefore compute energy expectation by summing over the weighted probabilities of possible energy outcomes:$$\Huge \langle H\rangle=\sum_j|c_j|^2E_j$$
Suppose that $V(x)\geq V_0$ is bounded below. Then we propose that $\langle H\rangle\geq V_0$. The energy expectation value is given by:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\langle H\rangle&=\langle \psi,\hat H\psi\rangle\\
&=\frac{1}{2m}\langle \psi,\hat p^2\psi\rangle+\langle \psi,V(x)\psi\rangle\\
&=\frac{1}{2m}\langle \hat p\psi,\hat p\psi\rangle+\langle \psi,V(x)\psi\rangle
\end{align}$$for the first term we see that$$\Huge \langle \hat p\psi,\hat p\psi\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^\infty|\hat p\psi(x)|^2dx=\int_{-\infty}^\infty|-i\psi'(x)|^2dx\geq0$$therefore we say$$\Huge \langle H\rangle\geq \langle \psi,V(x)\psi\rangle=\int_{-\infty }^\infty V(x)|\psi(x)|^2dx\geq V_0\int_{-\infty}^\infty|\psi(x)|^2dx=V_0$$where $V_0$ is the absolute minimum value of the potential function $V(x)$. To rule out equality we see that $\langle \hat p\psi,\hat p\psi\rangle=0$ implies that $\psi(x)$ is a constant, as this is determined by integrating over the spatial derivative of $\psi$. Therefore $\langle H\rangle>V_0$.

If $\psi(x)$ is a normalised eigenfunction of $H$ with corresponding eigenvalue $E$ then $E>V_0$, which is a consequence of $\langle H\rangle=\langle \psi,H\psi\rangle=E \langle \psi,\psi\rangle=E>0$. The smallest eigenvalue $E>V_0$ is sometimes called the zero-point energy.

## Non-degeneracy:
We propose that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate. 

Consider a pair of square normalisable eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue. We prove that $\psi_1(x)\propto\psi_2(x)$, which implies that there exists a unique normalised eigenfunction for each eigenvalue $E$. Expending the equations $\hat H\psi_1(x)=E\psi_1(x),\hat H\psi_2(x)=E\psi_2(x)$ gives:$$\Huge\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar }{2m}\partial_x^2\psi_1(x)+V(x)\psi_1(x)&=E\psi_1(x)\\
-\frac{\hbar}{2m}\partial_x^2\psi_2(x)+V(x)\psi_2(x)&=E\psi_2(x)
\end{align}$$Multiplying the top equation by $\psi_2(x)$ and the bottom by $\psi_1(x)$ then subtracting we see that:$$\Huge 0=\psi_1\partial_x^2\psi_2-\psi_2\partial_x^2\psi_1=\partial_x(\psi_1\partial_x\psi_2-\psi_2\partial_x\psi_1)$$where the contributions proportional to $V(x),E$ vanish. Therefore we have:$$\Huge \psi_1\partial_x\psi_2-\psi_2\partial_x\psi_1=c\in\mathbb{C}$$Evaluating this at infinity shows that $c=0$, as we require the wave functions to vanish at infinity. Therefore we have:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\psi_1\partial_x\psi_2-\psi_2\partial_x\psi_1&=0\\
\implies\frac{\partial_x\psi_1}{\psi_1}-\frac{\partial_x\psi_2}{\psi_2}&=\\
\implies\partial_x(\log\psi_1-\log\psi_2)&=0\\
\implies\log\frac{\psi_1}{\psi_2}&=A\\
\implies\psi_1=e^A\psi_2&=B\psi_2
\end{align}$$for some constant $B\in\mathbb{C}$. Therefore we have that $\psi_1(x)$ and $\psi_2(x)$ are the same eigenfunction, and the set of eigenfunctions/values are non-degenerate.
