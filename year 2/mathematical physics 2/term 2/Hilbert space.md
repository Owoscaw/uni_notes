Consider a finite dimensional complex [[Vector space definitions|vector space]] $V\cong\mathbb{C}^N$. We choose an orthonormal basis $\{ \underline e_j\}$ such that $\langle e_i,e_j\rangle$, where $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ represents the [[Inner product spaces#Complex inner products|Hermitian inner product]]. This allows any vector to be expressed as:$$\Huge \underline v=\sum_{j=0}^N v_j\underline e_j$$The Hermitian inner product can then be expressed as:$$\Huge \langle \underline v,\underline w\rangle=\sum_{j=0}^N\overline v_jw_j$$The square norm of a vector is then given by $|\underline v|^2=\langle \underline v,\underline v\rangle$. Solutions to [[Schrodinger's equation]] obey the principle of superposition, so can be thought of as members of an infinite dimensional vector space with inner product:$$\Huge \langle \psi_1,\psi_2\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\psi_1^*(x,t)\psi_2(x,t)dx$$One can show that this obeys the definition of the complex inner product. We aim to decompose  a solution $\psi$ to the equation onto some basis. We assume that the solutions can be counted, that is $\psi_n(x,t)$ form the basis and any solution is written as:$$\Huge\psi(x,t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\psi_n(x,t)$$[[Fourier Series#Parseval's Theorem|Parseval's theorem]] then states that:$$\Huge \langle \psi,\psi\rangle=\sum_{n=0}^\infty|c_n|^2$$
## Example: particle in a box:
Take the boundary condition $\psi(x=0)=\psi(x=l)=0$ with the solution:$$\Huge\phi_n(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)$$Which obeys $\langle \phi_n,\phi_m\rangle=\delta_{nm}$. The solution is then given by:$$\Huge\psi(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\phi_n(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)$$The coefficients $c_n$ are then found by taking the Hermitian inner product with $\phi_n(x)$:$$\Huge c_n=\langle \phi_n,\psi\rangle=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\int_0^L\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)dx$$
