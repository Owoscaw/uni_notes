Three useful features of classes and subclasses:
> Using classes allows the programmer to "bag" many variables into a single object that can be used easily
> Class constructors allow for the easy creation of objects, which could otherwise be tedious to define
> The use of subclasses allows for code to be re-used in similar classes
