# Problem 3.6:

$\Delta T$ is likely to reach $1.5$ in the year $2056$

The parameter $a$ represents the amount of temperature the Earth will change by without the effects of time

The parameter $b$ represents the increased amount of temperature the Earth will change by due to the human influences that year

# Problem 4.1:

$$\Huge \frac{d N}{dt}=R_0N\exp{(-R_1N)}-\frac{Y}{2}\left(1+\tanh \left(\frac{N-N_h}{K}\right) \right)$$
