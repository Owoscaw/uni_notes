# Balls:

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric spaces|metric space]], $r>0$ and $x\in X$. Then we define the open ball:$$\Huge B(x;r)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<r\}$$This is the open ball of radius $r$ around $x$. Furthermore we define the closed ball of radius $r$ around $x$:$$\Huge D(x;r)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)\leq r\}$$

Take the metric on $\Re^n$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ defined by:$$\Huge d_p(x,y)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-y_i|^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}$$The open and closed balls $B(0;1)$ and $D(0;1)$ are both defined on this metric, and can easily be visualised in $\Re,\Re^2,\Re^3$. These are generalised to the open and closed hyperspheres in $n$ dimensions.
