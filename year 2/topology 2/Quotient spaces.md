Let $X$ be a set and $\sim$ an equivalence relation on $X$. We define $X/\sim$ to be the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$. For $x\in X$ we write:$$\Huge [x]=\{y\in X:y\sim x\},\,\,X/\sim=\{[x]:x\in X\}$$We also define the surjective map:$$\Huge \pi:X\rightarrow X/\sim,\,\,x\mapsto[x]$$which takes elements of $x$ to their equivalence map.
