# Limit points, interiors, and closures:

Let $X$ be a [[Topological spaces#Topologies|topological space]] and $x\in X,A\subseteq X$:
> A neighbourhood of $x$ is a set $N\subseteq X$ with open subset $U$ such that $x\in U\subseteq N$
> A point $x\in X$ is called a limit point of $A$ if every neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ satisfies:$$\Huge (N\setminus\{x\})\cap A\neq\emptyset$$
