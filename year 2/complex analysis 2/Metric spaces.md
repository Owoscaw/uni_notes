A metric space is a set $X$ together with a function $d:X\times X\mapsto\Re_{\geq0}$ such that for all $x,y,z\in X$:
>Positivity: $d(x,y)=0\iff x=y$
>Symmetry: $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$
>Triangle inequality: $d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)$

$X$ is the set with elements that we want to find the distance of, and $d(x,y)$ is the distance between points $x$ and $y$. The function $d$ is called a metric, a metric space is often denoted as $(X,d)$. Examples of metrics:
> On $\Re$ or $\mathbb{C}$, $d(x)$
