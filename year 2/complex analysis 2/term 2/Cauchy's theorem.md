We aim to determine whether it is true that for [[Complex differentiation#Holomorphicity|holomorphic]] function $f$ on a domain $D$ then the [[Complex integration#Contour integrals|contour integral]] $\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0$ for all [[Complex integration#Contours|closed contours]] in $D$.

Recall that $\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i\neq0$, and that $|z|=1$ defines a closed contour. This function is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}^*$, which contains the contour. The problem arises from the anti-derivative $\text{Log}(z)=\ln|z|+i\text{Arg}(z)$, which is not holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}^*$.

# Starlike domains:

A [[Complex differentiation#Paths and connectedness|domain]] $D$ is called starlike if there exists a central point $a_0\in D$ such that for all $b\in D$ the straight line connecting $b$ and $a_0$ is fully contained within $D$. Note that $\mathbb{C}$ is starlike with $a_0=0$, and any [[Metric spaces#Open and closed sets|ball]] ($B_r(a)$) is starlike with $a_0=a$.
