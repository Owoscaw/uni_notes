To visualise functions $f:\mathbb{C}\mapsto \mathbb{C}$, $4$ dimensions are required. Two dimensions represent the input $z$, and two represent the output $f(z)$. Such functions are therefore visualised by observing where they take certain domains in $\mathbb{C}$.

 Consider the function $f(z)$ and $g(z)=\arg z$ and the images of $\mathbb{D}=\{z\in \mathbb{C}:|z|<1\}$ under $f$ and $g$:![[Complex differentiation .excalidraw]]
