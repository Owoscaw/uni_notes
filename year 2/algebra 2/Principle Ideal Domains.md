Recall for a commutative ring $R=\mathbb{Z}$ or $F[x]$ with $F$ a [[Rings, subrings, and fields#Fields|field]]:$$\Huge (a,b)=(\gcd(a,b))$$An [[Integral domains, units, and polynomial rings|integral domain]] in which all [[Ideals]] are principle is called principle ideal domain (PID). We propose that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$ are PIDs. Let $R$ be either $\mathbb{Z}$ or $F[x]$ and define:$$\Huge d:R\setminus\{0\}\mapsto\mathbb{N},\,\,d(a)=\begin{cases}|a|&R=\mathbb{Z}\\\deg a&R=F[x]\end{cases}$$Let $I$ be an ideal in $R$. If $I=\{0\}=0$ then $I$ is principle. So assume $I\neq0$ and let $m\in I$ with $m\neq0$ such that $d(m)$ is minimal for all elements in $I$. That is for any $b\in I$, $d(b)\geq d(m)$. We then aim to show that $I=(m)$, which is principle. Let $a\in I$, then dividing by $m$ we see that $a=q\cdot m+r$ with $d(r)<d(m)$. If $r\neq0$ this contradicts the minimality of $m$ since $r=a-qm\in I$, therefore we must have $r=0$. This implies that $a=qm\implies a\in(m)\implies I=(m)$ is a principle ideal. Therefore all ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$ are principle, making them PIDs.

We propose that being a PID implies being a [[Factorisation in rings#Unique factorisation domains|UFD]]. The proof is omitted.

We can directly show $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a PID. The ideal $(3,1+\sqrt{-5})\in\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not principle, so assume that it is of the form $(a)$, then we have:$$\Huge 3=ax_1,\,\,1+\sqrt{-5}=ax_2$$For some $x_1,x_2\in\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. After applying the Norm map, we see that $N(a)$ divides both $N(3)=9$ and $N(1+\sqrt{-5})=6$, therefore $N(a)=1$ or $3$, as these are the common factors of $9$ and $3$. There is no element with norm of $3$, so we have that $N(a)=1\implies a=\pm1$ is a unit, implying that $(a)=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ however $(3,1+\sqrt{-5})\neq\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. If that were the case we should be able to write:$$\Huge 1=(x+y\sqrt{-5})3+(z+w\sqrt{-5})=(3x+z-5w)+(3y+z+w)\sqrt{-5}$$Since $1\in\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ for some $x,y,z,w\in\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $3x+z-5w=1$ and $3y+z+w=0$. The last equation implies $\overline{3y+z+w}=\bar z+\bar w=\bar 0$, however the second implies $\overline{3x+z-5w}=\bar z+\bar w=\bar 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore the ideal above is not the whole ring and we have that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is indeed not a PID. Note that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{\pm2}]$ are both PIDs.

Let $R$ be a PID and $a,b\in R$. Then $d=\gcd(a,b)$ exists and $(d)=(a,b)$. Let $d\in R$ satisfy the claim, then $a=dm$ and $b=dn$ for some $m,n\in R$. Suppose there exists some $e\in R$ such that $a=em'$ and $b=en'$ for some $m',n'\in R$
