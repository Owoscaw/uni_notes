Recall for a commutative ring $R=\mathbb{Z}$ or $F[x]$ with $F$ a [[Rings, subrings, and fields#Fields|field]]:$$\Huge (a,b)=(\gcd(a,b))$$An [[Integral domains, units, and polynomial rings|integral domain]] in which all [[Ideals]] are principle is called principle ideal domain (PID). We propose that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$ are PIDs. Let $R$ be either $\mathbb{Z}$ or $F[x]$ and define:$$\Huge d:R\setminus\{0\}\mapsto\mathbb{N},\,\,d(a)=\begin{cases}|a|&R=\mathbb{Z}\\\deg a&R=F[x]\end{cases}$$Let $I$ be an ideal in $R$. If $I=\{0\}=0$ then $I$ is principle. So assume $I\neq0$ and let $m\in I$ with $m\neq0$ such that $d(m)$ is minimal for all elements in $I$. That is for any $b\in I$, $d(b)\geq d(m)$. We then aim to show that $I=(m)$, which is principle. Let $a\in I$, then dividing by $m$ we see that $a=q\cdot m+r$ with $d(r)<d(m)$. If $r\neq0$ this contradicts the minimality of $m$ since $r=a-qm\in I$, therefore we must have $r=0$. This implies that $a=qm\implies a\in(m)\implies I=(m)$ is a principle ideal. Therefore all ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[x]$ are principle, making them PIDs.

We propose that being a PID implies being a [[Factorisation in rings#Unique factorisation domains|UFD]].
