A [[Rings, subrings, and fields|ring]] $R$ which is commutative has at least two elements, and does not have any [[Rings, subrings, and fields#Fields|zero divisors]] other than $0$. This ring is then called an integral domain.

Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then the ring $R[x]_n=\{a_0+a_1x+\dots+a_nx^n:a_i\in R\}$ is also an integral domain. Let $f(x)\in R[x]_n,g(x)\in R[x]_m$, with $m\geq n$ then we have:$$\Huge f(x)+g(x)=(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+\dots+(a_n+b_n)x^n+\dots+b_mx^m$$$$\Huge f(x)g(x)=c_0+c_1x+\dots+c_nx^{m+n}$$Where:$$\Huge c_k=\sum_{j=0}^ka_kb_{k-j}$$So we have that $R[x]$ is a commutative ring.
