# Cauchy's Theorem:
Let $G$ be a finite [[Basics of groups|group]] and $p$ a prime such that $p$ divides $|G|$. Then there is a subgroup of $G$ of order $p$.

To prove this, we look for $x\in G$ such that the order of $x$ is $p$, that is $x^p=e$ with $x\neq e$. The proof strategy involves the composition of a set with order divisible by $p$ on which $\mathbb{Z}/p$ acts. This gives rise to a non-trivial [[Group actions#Orbits and stabilisers|orbit]] of size $1$ from which we find a subgroup of order $p$. We will look at the repeated direct product $G\times G\times G\times\dots\times G$ applied $p$ times. It is clear that this is also a group. We define this as:$$\Huge \Omega=\{(x_1,\dots,x_p)\in G\times\dots\times G:x_1x_2\dots x_p=e\}$$We claim that there is an [[Group actions|action]] of $\mathbb{Z}/p$ on the repeated product such that:$$\Huge\begin{align}
\varphi:\mathbb{Z}/p&\rightarrow S_{G\times\dots\times G}\\
\bar 1\mapsto\beta_{\bar 1}:G\times\dots\times G&\rightarrow G\times\dots\times G\\
(x_1,\dots,x_p)&\mapsto(x_2,x_3,\dots,x_p,x_1)\\
\bar m\mapsto\beta_{\bar m}:(x_1,\dots,x_p)&\mapsto(x_{m+1},\dots,x_p,x_1,\dots,x_m)
\end{align}$$This also induces an action on $\Omega$ as if $(x_1,\dots,x_p)\in\Omega$ then $x_1^{-1}x_1\dots x_p=x_1^{-1}$ therefore $x_2\dots x_px_1=x_1^{-1}x_1=e\in\Omega$, that is $(x_2,\dots,x_px_1)\in\Omega$ and similarly $(x_{m+1}\dots,x_p,x_1,\dots,x_m)\in\Omega$. Now by the [[Group actions#Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem|OST]] any orbit of $\Omega$ divides $|\mathbb{Z}/p|=p$ and hence must be equal to $1$ or $p$. It is obvious that $(e,e,\dots,e)\in\Omega$ has orbit size of $1$. We now show that there is such an orbit of size $1$ that is not trivial that will in turn give $x^p=e$. First we find $|\Omega|$ in relation to $|G|$. We claim that $|\Omega|=|G|^{p-1}$, we see that $\Omega$ is partitioned by its orbits under $\mathbb{Z}/p$:$$\Huge |\Omega|=\sum_\text{size 1 orbits}1+\sum_\text{size p orbits}p$$Now since $p$ divides $|G|$ we must have that $p$ divides $|\Omega|$. It is obvious that $p$ divides the right sum, so we must have that $p$ divides the number of orbits of size $1$, therefore there must be at least $p-1$ non-trivial orbits of size $1$ for this to be true. Such an orbit will have form:$$\Huge (g,g,\dots,g)\in\Omega\implies g^p=e$$Proving the theorem.
