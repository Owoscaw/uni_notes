A homomorphism of [[Basics of groups|group]]s is a map $\varphi:G\rightarrow G'$ between two groups, $G$ and $G'$ such that:$$\Huge \varphi(g_1g_2)=\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)\,\,\forall g_1,g_2\in G$$
An isomorphism of groups is a homomorphism of groups that is bijective. Groups $G,G'$ are isomorphic to each other if there exists an isomorphism between them, in such case we write:$$\Huge G\cong G'$$

The kernel of a group homomorphism is the set:$$\Huge \ker\varphi=\{g\in G:\varphi(g)=e\}$$The image of a group is the set:$$\Huge \text{im }\varphi=\{\varphi(g):g\in G\}$$
