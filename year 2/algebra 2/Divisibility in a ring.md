Let $R$ be a [[Rings, subrings, and fields|commutative ring]]. Let $a,b\in R$. We say that $a$ divides $b$ in $R$ and write $a|b$ if there exists $r\in R$ such that $b=r\cdot a$. An element $d\in R$ is called a greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ if the following hold:
> $d|a$ and $d|b$
> If $e\in R$ divides both $a,b$, then $e|d$

Note that according to the definition above, both $-1$ and $1$ are a $\gcd(2,3)$ with $R=\mathbb{Z}$, however since $\mathbb{Z}$ has an ordering, we can define the greatest common divisor as $1$. We must also define:$$\Huge \gcd(0,0):=0$$Note that $\gcd(a,b)$ does not exist for every $a,b$ in every ring $R$.
