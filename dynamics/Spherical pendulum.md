A mass $m$ is attatched to one end of a light rigid rod of length $Q$, the other end is attatched to a fixed point with the rod free to rotate in any direction. Gravity acts downwards with initial condition where the rod is horizontal, velocity is horizontal, and speed is $u$. We ask what distance $D$ below horizontal does the mass reach?

Clearly when $g=0$, the mass does not swing downwards and we get [[Angular momentum and Central forces#Planar motion and Motion under central force|circular motion]] along the equator. When $u=0$ we get a simple pendulum and can determine that $D=Q$. We choose $z$ and $\underline k$ to be vertically downwards, and use polar coordinates along the horizontal. So we use $(r,\theta)$ with $(\underline e_r, \underline e_\theta)$, making the pivot at $z=0,r=0$. We write the position vector of the mass:$$\Huge \underline R=z \underline k+r \underline e_r$$Note that $\underline R\cdot \underline R=Q^2$, the distance from the origin is always $Q$. This implies that $\underline R\cdot\dot{\underline R}=0$ and $z^2+r^2=Q^2$:$$\Huge \underline{\dot R}=\dot z\underline k+\dot r\underline e_r+r\dot \theta\underline e_\theta$$Kinetic energy is:$$\Huge K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}m(\underline{\dot R}\cdot \underline{\dot R})=\frac{1}{2}m(\dot z^2+\dot r^2+r^2\dot \theta^2)$$We then claim that potential energy is:$$\Huge V=-mgz$$We look at the equation of motion to verify that total energy is conserved:$$\Huge m \underline{\ddot R}=mg \underline k+I$$Where $I$ is the tension along the rod, that is $I=h \underline R$ for some function $h$.$$\Huge \frac{dE}{dt}=m\underline{\dot R}\cdot\underline{\ddot R}-mg\dot z=\underline{\dot R}\cdot(mg \underline k+I)-mg\dot z$$Since $\underline R\cdot\underline{\dot R}=0$ , $I$ is proportional to $\underline R$, and $\underline{\dot R}\cdot \underline k=\dot z$ we get:$$\Huge \frac{dE}{dt}=0+mg\dot z-mg\dot z=0$$So we indeed have energy conserved. Our expressions are still very complex, so we aim to eliminate $\dot \theta^2$ by observing angular momentum $\underline L=m \underline R\times \underline{\dot R}$. However due to the additional gravitational force, angular momentum is not conserved as a vector. Not all hope is lost however, as we claim that the $\underline k$-component of angular momentum is conserved. That is, $\frac{dL_z}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(\underline L\cdot \underline k)=0$:$$\Huge \frac{dL_z}{dt}=m \frac{d}{dt}(\underline R\times \underline{\dot R})$$
