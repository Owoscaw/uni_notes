Consider a particle on the line in the case [[Particle on a line#Case $F=F(x)$|$F=F(x)$]] and write $V(x)=-\int F(x)dx$ then you can write:$$\Huge \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\right)=mv\frac{dv}{dx}=ma=F=-\frac{dV}{dx}$$So we then define:$$\Huge E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+V(x)$$This is constant over time, since the chain rule gives:$$\Huge \frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{dE}{dx}\dot x=0$$The quantity $E$ is the energy of the particle, which is always conserved. The equation for energy contains two terms, $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and $V(x)$. The latter of these is the particle's kinetic energy, whereas the former is the particles potential energy. This leads to the following conclusions:
> A force in the form $F(x)$ is said to be conservative, as it causes energy to be conserved.
> Potential $V$ and energy $E$ are only defined up to an arbitrary constant.
> When $F(x)$ is constant, $V$ is linear in $x$.
> Using the conservation of energy, an idea of the particles motion can be gained without finding $x(t)$.
> $E$, energy, is constant for a given solution.

# Simple harmonic oscillator:

A simple approximation for an object in SHM is Hooke's law, which states that the restoring force towards equilibrium is equal to:$$\Huge F=-kx$$Where $k>0$ is the spring constant.
