Consider a particle on the line in the case [[Particle on a line#Case $F=F(x)$|$F=F(x)$]] and write $V(x)=-\int F(x)dx$ then you can write:$$\Huge \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}mv^2+V\right)=mv\frac{dv}{dx}-F=0$$So we then define:$$\Huge E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+V$$This is constant over time, since the chain rule gives:$$\Huge \frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{dE}{dx}\dot x=0,\,\text{since }\frac{dx}{dt}=0$$The quantity $E$ is the energy of the particle, which is always conserved. The equation for energy contains two terms, $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and $V(x)$. The latter of these is the particle's kinetic energy, whereas the former is the particles potential energy. This leads to the following conclusions:
> A force in the form $F(x)$ is said to be conservative, as it causes energy to be conserved. Note that the cases where $F=F(t)$ or $F=F(\dot x)$ are not necessarily conservative.
> Potential $V$ and energy $E$ are only defined up to an arbitrary constant.
> When $F(x)$ is constant, $V$ is linear in $x$.
> Using the conservation of energy, an idea of the particles motion can be gained without finding $x(t)$.
> $E$, energy, is constant for a given solution.
> A point where $F(x)=0$ is called an equilibrium point.
