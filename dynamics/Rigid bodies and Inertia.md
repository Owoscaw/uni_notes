A rigid body is a collection of masses such that the distance between the masses is fixed. If the body is not rotating, it behaves like a single particle. Consider masses $m_1,\dots,m_N$ at positions $\underline r_1,\dots, \underline r_N$. The single particle has mass $M=m_1+\dots+m_N$ and the position of the centre of mass is $\underline R=\frac{1}{M}(m_1 \underline r_1+\dots+m_N \underline r_N)$, the weighted position of masses.

Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, each $m_i$ moves in a circle as an angle $\theta$ changes. The configuration as a function of time is described as $\theta(t)$, all $m_i$ have the same angular velocity $\dot\theta$. Circular motion means that each $m_i$ has speed $v_i= \underline r_i|\dot\theta|$, making the total kinetic energy:$$\Huge K=\sum_i\frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2=\frac{1}{2}\sum_i m_i \underline r_i^2|\dot\theta|^2$$The quantity $\sum_i m_i \underline r_i^2$ is called the moment of inertia $I$ of the body about the given axis:$$\Huge K=\frac{1}{2}I\dot\theta^2$$For a continuous rigid body, the sum needs to be replaced with an integral. Consider a uniform rigid rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ pivoted about an axis at one end, perpendicular. The moment of inertia is found by laying the rod on the $x$-axis at $x=0$. At the point At the point $x=0$, its moment of intertia is $M(\frac{dx}{dL})x^2$, making the mom
