A rigid body is a collection of masses such that the distance between the masses is fixed. If the body is not rotating, it behaves like a single particle. Consider masses $m_1,\dots,m_N$ at positions $\underline r_1,\dots, \underline r_N$. The single particle has mass $M=m_1+\dots+m_N$ and the position of the centre of mass is $\underline R=\frac{1}{M}(m_1 \underline r_1+\dots+m_N \underline r_N)$, the weighted position of masses.

Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, each $m_i$ moves in a circle as an angle
