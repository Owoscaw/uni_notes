A string lies on the $x$-axis under tension. It has mass per unit length of $\rho$. Consider a short segment of the string, running from $x$ to $x+\delta x$. Make a transverse displacement of the string such that it is "plucked". This displacement is described by $u(t,x)$. Then define $\theta$ as the angle that the line segment between the point on the string at $x$ and at $x+\delta x$ makes with horizontal, such that $\theta$ and $\delta u$ are small. The equation of motion becomes:$$\Huge (\rho\,\delta x)\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2}=T\sin\theta(x+\delta x)-T\sin\theta\,x$$Where $T$ is the constant tension in the string. Note that since $\theta$ is small, horizontal components of force along the line segment will cancel as $T\cos\theta\approx T$. This is not that useful in terms of $\theta$ so we work to express $\theta$ in terms of $u$. Considering the triangle made between the point at $x$ and $x+\delta x$, we can see that:$$\Huge \tan\theta=\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\approx \sin\theta$$Since we are considering small $\theta$. Putting these together we get:$$\Huge \rho\frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial t^2}=T\frac{1}{\delta x}[\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}(x+\delta x)=\]$$
