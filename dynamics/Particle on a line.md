A particle on the $x$ axis can have its position described by a function $x(t)$ where $t$ denotes time. The velocity of this particle can be described by the time derivative of it's position, that is $v(t)=\dot x$. Here, $\cdot$ denotes $\frac{d}{dt}$. Similarly, the acceleration of the particle is described by the time derivative of it's velocity, $\ddot x(t)$.

The particle also has a property, mass ($m>0$). Then the mom
