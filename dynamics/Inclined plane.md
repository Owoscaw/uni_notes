A mass $m$ slides down a [[Planes in R3|plane]] inclined at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal. There is then a normal force $\underline N$ that acts perpendicular to the plane. A frictional force acts up the plane with magnitude $\mu\underline N$ for a constant $\mu>0$:![[inclined plane diagram]]The question then becomes: Starting from rest, how far does the mass travel in time $t$? This then begs the question: How large does $\alpha$ have to be for the mass to move at all?

One choice of basis is to have $\underline i$ directly down the slope, then [[Dynamics in space|$\underline r(t)$]] becomes trivial, $\underline r(t)=x(t)\underline i$:![[inclined plane in space]]The equation of motion becomes:$$\Huge m\ddot x\underline i=|\underline N|\underline j-\mu|\underline N|\underline i+mg\sin\alpha\underline i-mg\cos\alpha\underline j$$Since the RHS has no $\underline j$ component, they must cancel each other:$$\Huge |\underline N|\underline j-mg\cos\alpha\underline j=0$$$$\Huge m\ddot x\underline i=mg\sin\alpha\underline i-\mu|\underline N|\underline i$$Which gives the following equations:$$\Huge |\underline N|=mg\cos\alpha,\,\,\ddot x=g(\sin\alpha-\mu\cos\alpha)$$To find $x(t)$, you can integrate twice wrt $t$, since the trig terms are constant:$$\Huge x(t)=\frac{1}{2}t^2g(\sin\alpha-\mu\cos\alpha)$$This only has physical significance when $\sin\alpha>\mu\cos\alpha$.
