$\Re^n$ represents the vector space of all column vectors such that:
$$\Large \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix},x_i\in\Re\,,n\geq1$$
Represented as a set:
$$\Huge \Re^n=\left\{\underline x=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}:x_i\in\Re\,\,for\,\,i=1,\dots,n\right\}$$
# Zero vector and Standard Basis vectors:

The Zero vector is defined as a vector who's elements are all zero for however many dimensions it is defined for:
$$\Huge \underline 0=\begin{pmatrix}0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}\in\Re^n$$
Standard basis vectors are defined such that all of their elements are zero except for one, which is one. The position of the one determines which standar
