A sequence of real numbers is a function, $\mathbb{N}\mapsto\Re$. Each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ has an assigned value $x_n\in\Re$, denoted as $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. The following are different types of sequences:
> Let $x_n=\lambda$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N},\,\lambda\in\Re$. This is called a constant sequence.
> Let $x_n=\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
> Let $x_n=(-1)^n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, this oscillates between $+1$ and $-1$.
> Let $x_n=x_{n-1}+x_{n-2}$, with $x_1=1,\,x_2=1$, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}>2$. This is defined recursively, in terms of other elements of the sequence.
