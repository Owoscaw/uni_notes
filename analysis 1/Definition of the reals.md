$0 < 1$ is the most important thing proven in [[Axiom definitions|the definition of axioms]]. From this, we can use the monotony of addition to say the following:
$$\Huge 0<1,\,0+1<1+1,\,0+1+1<1+1+1,\dots$$
All these numbers are defined to be different, so the notation of different numbers introduced. This is to say, at long last:
$$\Huge 1+1=2$$
The definition of the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, follows. That is, $\mathbb{N}$ is the smallest possible subset of $\Re$ that contains 1. For any number in $\mathbb{N}$, its successor is also in $\mathbb{N}$:
$$\Huge \forall n\in\mathbb{N},\,n+1\in\mathbb{N}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{N}=\left\{1,2,3,\dots\right\}$$
$$\Huge \mathbb{N}_0=\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$$
The set of integers is then defined as:
$$\Huge \mathbb{Z}=\left\{n:n\in\mathbb{N}_0,-n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$$
From this, the set of rational numbers can then be built:
$$\Huge \mathbb{Q}=\left\{n\cdot m^{-1}:n\in\mathbb{Z},m\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$$
Note that $n\cdot m^{-1}$ is typically written as $\frac{n}{m}$. In general, $x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x}$, $$
