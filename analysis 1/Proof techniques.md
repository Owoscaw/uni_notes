# Contrapositive:

The general technique for a contrapositive proof is summarised as follows. Let $A,B$ be statements. The statement "If $A$ then $B$" is equivalent to "If not $B$ then not $A$". This can be shown through a truth table:
$A$|$B$|$A\implies B$|not $B$|not $A$|not $B\implies$not $A$
T|T|T|F|F|T
T|F|F|T|F|F
F|T|T|F|T|T
F|F|T|T|T|T

# Indirect:

The technique for an indirect proof involves showing that for any statement $A$, not $A$ is false, so $A$ must be true, as $not(not(A))$ is $A$.

# Negations:

"For all $x$ we have $A(x)$" is negated by "There exists $x$ with not $A(x)$", "There exists $x$ with $B(x)$" is negated by "For all $x$ we have not $B(x)$". In general, For all negates There exists.

Let $A,B$ be statements. The negation of $A\implies B$ is $A$ and not $B$.
