Let $a_1,\dots,a_n$ be $n$ real numbers. The sum of these numbers is denoted as $\sum_{i=1}^n=a_1+\dots+a_n$. Their product is denoted as $\Pi_{i=1}^n=a_1\dots a_n$. For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the factorial of $n$ is denoted as $\Pi_{i=1}^ni=n!$. Note that $0!$ is defined to be 1.

# Binomial coefficient:

For $n,k\in\mathbb{N}_0$, given $k\leq n$, the binomial coefficient is defined as:
$$\Huge \begin{pmatrix}n\\k\end{pmatrix}=\frac{n!}{()}$$
