Let $X\subset\Re$ be open, and $f:X\mapsto\Re$  a function. $f$ is called differentiable at a point $c\in X$ if the following exists:$$\Huge \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}$$This is denoted as $f^\prime(c)$, where $f^\prime(c)$ is the derivative of $f$ at $c$. A function is called differentiable if for all $c\in X$, it is differentiable at $x=c$. This expression has a geometric interpretation, it is the slope of the line between points $(c,f(c))$ and $(x,f(x))$.

Let $f:X\mapsto\Re$ be a function. Then $f$ is differentiable at $c\in X$ if and only if the following holds: There exists $m\in\Re$ and a function $r(x)$ such that:$$\Huge f(x)=f(c)+m(x-c)+r(x)(x-c)$$With $r$ continuous at $c$ and $\lim_{x\to c}r(x)=r(c)=0$. Let $f:X\mapsto\Re$ be a function where $X\subset\Re$. Then $f$ is differentiable at $c\in X$ if and only if the following holds:$$\Huge \exists m\in\Re,r(x):f(x)=f(c)+m(x-c)+r(x)(x-c)$$With $r$ [[Continuity|continuous]] at $c$ and $\lim_{x\to c}r(x)=r(c)=0$. Here, $m=f'(c)$. We prove this as follows:![[differentiability at a point proof]]
