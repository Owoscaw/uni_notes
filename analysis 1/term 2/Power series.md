A real power series is an expression of the form:$$\Huge \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k$$This may or may not [[Series#Convergence criteria|converge]] for various $x$. Note that if $\sum_{k=0}a_k$ converges, then $\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k=0$. We use various results from [[Series|series]].

# Radius of Convergence:

A power series is an infinite series of form:$$\Huge \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k$$With $a_k\in\Re$ and $x\in\Re$. The Cauchy-Hadamard theorem states that for such a power series, there exists a constant $R\in[0,\infty]$ such that:
> If $R=0$, then the series converges only for $x=0$
> If $R>0$, then the series converges absolutely for $x\in(-R,R)$
