# Regulated integral

Let $f$ be a [[Regulated functions#Step functions|step function]] on $[a,b]$ associated to a partition $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$ and let $x_k^*\in(x_k,x_{k+1})$, on which $f$ is constant. Then the integral $I(f)$ of $f$ is defined by:$$\Huge I(f)=I(f,a,b)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}f(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$Note that if $a=y_0<y_1<\dots<y_{M-1}<y_M=b$ is another partition, then:$$\Huge I(f)=\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f(y_k^*)(y_{k+1}-y_k)$$
Let a regulated function on $[a,b]$, say that $f$ is the uniform limit of the step functions $f_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then we define:$$\Huge I(f)=\lim_{n\to \infty}I(f_n)$$However we quire that this sequence $I(f_n)$ converges, and that this limit should not depend on the sequence of step functions. Let $f$ be a regulated function on $[a,b]$ and $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of step function with $f_n\to f$ uniformly. Then the sequence $(I(f_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. To prove this, for $\epsilon>0$ take $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)}$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ and all $n\geq N$. Let $n,m\geq N$, we require $|I(f_n)-I(f_m)|<\epsilon$ since this means $(I(f_n))$ form a cauchy sequence. Now let $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{M-1}<x_M=b$ be a common refinement of $f_n$ and $f_m$:$$\big |I(f_n)-I(f_m)|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)-f_m(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|=|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-f_m(x_k^*))(x_{k+1}-x_k)|$$$$\implies\small |\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)+f(x_k^*)-f_m(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)|<\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(|f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)|+|f_m(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)|)(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$$$\Huge\implies|I(f_n)-I(f_m)|<\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}\frac{\epsilon}{b-a}(x_{k+1}-x_k)=\epsilon$$So we have these sequences are cauchy sequences, and the sequence $(I(f_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges.

Let $f$ be a regulated function on $[a,b]$ and let $(f_n),(g_n)$ be sequences of step functions converging uniformly to $f$, then:$$\Huge \lim_{n\to \infty}I(f_n)=\lim_{n\to \infty}I(g_n)$$To prove this, pick a common refinement for each $f_n,g_n$ and let $\epsilon>0$. Pick $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)}$ for all $n\geq N$, then:$$ |I(f_n)-I(g_n)|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)-g_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-g_n(x_k^*))(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|$$$$\Huge \implies|I(f_n)-I(g_n)|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)+f(x_k^*)-g_n(x_k^*))(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|$$$$\implies |I(f_n)-I(g_n)|\leq\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(|f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)|+|f(x_k^*)-g_n(x_k^*)|)(x_{k+1}-x_k)<\frac{\epsilon}{b-a}\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(x_{k+1}-x_k)=\epsilon$$So we get that $f,g$ are cauchy sequences and therefore share the same limit, as require. For a regulated function, we write:$$\Huge I(f)=I(f,a,b)=\int_a^bf(x)dx$$
## Properties:
Let $f$ and $g$ be regulated functions on $[a,g]$ then:
> Linearity, for $c\in\Re$:$$\Huge\int_a^bcf(x)dx=c\int_a^bf(x)dx,\,\,\int_a^bf(x)+g(x)dx=\int_a^bf(x)dx+\int_a^bg(x)dx$$If $f(x)\leq g(x)$ for all $x\in[a,b]$, then:$$\Huge \int_a^bf(x)dx\leq\int_a^bg(x)dx$$Furthermore, set $m=\inf\{f(x)|x\in[a,b]\}, M=\sup\{f(x):x\in[a,b]\}$, then:$$\Huge m(b-a)\leq\int_a^bf(x)dx\leq M(b-a)$$Finally:$$\Huge \left|\int_a^bf(x)dx\right|\leq\int_a^b|f(x)|dx$$

To prove linearity, let $(f_n)$ be a sequence of step function converging uniformly to $f$, similarly for $(g_n)\to f$ and assume $f_n,g_n$ are defined on the same partition. Then $cf_n\to cf$ uniformly, and $\lim_{n\to \infty}I(cf_n)=I(cf)$. Then we get $I(cf_n)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}cf_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)=cI(f_n)$, hence $\lim_{n\to \infty}I(cf_n)=\lim_{n\to \infty}cI(f_n)=c\lim_{n\to \infty}I(f_n)=cI(f)$.

Since $m,M$ are well defined, $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ and we have $m\leq f(x)\leq M$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. Therefore we get:$$\Huge m(b-a)=\int_a^bmdx\leq\int_a^bf(x)dx\leq\int_a^bMdx=M(b-a)$$
$|f(x)|\geq f(x)$ and $|f(x)|\geq-f(x)$ implies that $\int_a^b|f(x)|dx\geq\int_a^bf(x)dx$ and $\int_a^b|f(x)|dx\geq-\int_a^bf(x)$, which implies the statement as required.

Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$ such that $f(x)\geq0$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ and $f(c)>0$ for some $c\in[a,b]$, then:$$\Huge \int_a^bf(x)dx>0$$Since by continuity there exists a non-trivial interval $[\alpha,\beta]$ containing $c$ such that $f(x)\geq \frac{C}{2}$ where $C=f(c)>0$. Choose $\epsilon=\frac{C}{2}>0$, now there exists $\delta>$
## Additivity:
For any $c\in(a,b)$, $f$ is also regulated on $[a,c],[c,b]$ and we have:$$\Huge \int_a^bf(x)dx=\int_a^cf(x)dx+\int_c^bf(x)dx$$Since $f_n\to f$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$, it still converges uniformly on smaller intervals, like $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$. When $f_n$ is restricted to these intervals, it remains a step function. We assume $c$ to be a part of the partition for each $f_n$, then $I(f_n,a,b)=I(f_n,a,c)+I(f_n,c,b)$.

# MVT for integrals:

Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$, then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ such that:$$\Huge \int_a^bf(x)dx=f(c)(b-a)$$Let $C=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$ and $m=\inf\{f(x):x\in[a,b]\},M=\sup\{f(x):x\in[a,b]\}$. We then have $m\leq C\leq M$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists $x\in[a,b]$ and $y\in[a,b]$ with $f(x)=m$ and $f(y)=M$. By the intermediate value theorem, there exists $c\in[x,y]:f(c)=C$. Multiplying this equation by $b-a$ gives the result as required.
