# Regulated integral

Let $f$ be a [[Regulated functions#Step functions|step function]] on $[a,b]$ associated to a partition $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$ and let $x_k^*\in(x_k,x_{k+1})$, on which $f$ is constant. Then the integral $I(f)$ of $f$ is defined by:$$\Huge I(f)=I(f,a,b)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}f(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$Note that if $a=y_0<y_1<\dots<y_{M-1}<y_M=b$ is another partition, then:$$\Huge I(f)=\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f(y_k^*)(y_{k+1}-y_k)$$
Let a regulated function on $[a,b]$, say that $f$ is the uniform limit of the step functions $f_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then we define:$$\Huge I(f)=\lim_{n\to \infty}I(f_n)$$However we quire that this sequence $I(f_n)$ converges, and that this limit should not depend on the sequence of step functions. Let $f$ be a regulated function on $[a,b]$ and $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of step function with $f_n\to f$ uniformly. Then the sequence $(I(f_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. To prove this, for $\epsilon>0$ take $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)}$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ and all $n\geq N$. Let $n,m\geq N$, we require $|I(f_n)-I(f_m)|<\epsilon$ since this means $(I(f_n))$ form a cauchy sequence. Now let $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{M-1}<x_M=b$ be a common refinement of $f_n$ and $f_m$:$$\big |I(f_n)-I(f_m)|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)-f_m(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|=|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-f_m(x_k^*))(x_{k+1}-x_k)|$$$$\implies\small |\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)+f(x_k^*)-f_m(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)|<\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(|f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)|+|f_m(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)|)(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$$$\Huge\implies|I(f_n)-I(f_m)|<\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}\frac{\epsilon}{b-a}(x_{k+1}-x_k)=\epsilon$$So we have these sequences are cauchy sequences, and the sequence $(I(f_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges.

Let $f$ be a regulated function on $[a,b]$ and let $(f_n),(g_n)$ be sequences of step functions converging uniformly to $f$, then:$$\Huge \lim_{n\to \infty}I(f_n)=\lim_{n\to \infty}I(g_n)$$To prove this, pick a common refinement for each $f_n,g_n$ and let $\epsilon>0$. Pick $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)}$ for all $n\geq N$, then:$$ |I(f_n)-I(g_n)|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)-g_n(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-g_n(x_k^*))(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|$$$$\Huge \implies|I(f_n)-I(g_n)|=\left|\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)+f(x_k^*)-g_n(x_k^*))(x_{k+1}-x_k)\right|$$$$\implies |I(f_n)-I(g_n)|\leq\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(|f_n(x_k^*)-f(x_k^*)|+|f(x_k^*)-g_n(x_k^*)|)(x_{k+1}-x_k)<\frac{\epsilon}{b-a}\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}(x_{k+1}-x_k)=\epsilon$$So we get that $f,g$ are cauchy sequences and therefore share the same limit, as require. For a regulated function, we write:$$\Huge I(f)=I(f,a,b)=\int_a^bf(x)dx$$
## Properties:
Let $f$ and $g$ be regulated functions on $[a,g]$ then:
> Linearity, for $c\in\Re$:$$\Huge\int_a^bcf(x)dx=c\int_a^bf(x)dx,\,\,\int_a^bf(x)+g(x)dx=\int_a^bf(x)dx+\int_a^bg(x)dx$$If $f(x)\leq g(x)$ for all $x\in[a,b]$, then:$$\Huge \int_a^bf(x)dx\leq\int_a^bg(x)dx$$

furthermore, set $m=\inf\{f(x)|x\in[a,b]\}$, then:$$\Huge m(b-a)\leq\int_c^a$$
