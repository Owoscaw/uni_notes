# Regulated integral

Let $f$ be a [[Regulated functions#Step functions|step function]] on $[a,b]$ associated to a partition $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$ and let $x_k^*\in(x_k,x_{k+1})$, on which $f$ is constant. Then the integral $I(f)$ of $f$ is defined by:$$\Huge I(f)=I(f,a,b)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}f(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$Note that if $a=y_0<y_1<\dots<y_{M-1}<y_M=b$ is another partition, then:$$\Huge I(f)=\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f(y_k^*)(y_{k+1}-y_k)$$
Let a regulated function on $[a,b]$, say that $f$ is the uniform limit of the step functions $f_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then we define:$$\Huge I(f)=\lim_{n\to \infty}I(f_n)$$However we quire that this sequence $I(f_n)$ converges, and that this limit should not depend on the sequence of step functions. Let $f$ be a regulated function on $[a,b]$ and $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of step function with $f_n\to f$ uniformly. Then the sequence $(I(f_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. To prove this, for $\epsilon>0$ take $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)}$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ and all $n\geq N$. Let $n,m\geq N$, we require $|I(f_n)|$
