# Regulated integral

Let $f$ be a [[Regulated functions#Step functions|step function]] on $[a,b]$ associated to a partition $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$ and let $x_k^*\in(x_k,x_{k+1})$, on which $f$ is constant. Then the integral $I(f)$ of $f$ is defined by:$$\Huge I(f)=I(f,a,b)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}f(x_k^*)(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$Note that if $a=y_0<y_1<\dots<y_{M-1}<y_M=b$ is another partition,
