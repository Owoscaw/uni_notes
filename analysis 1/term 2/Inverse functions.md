If the [[Injective functions|injective function]] $f$ is [[Differentiable Functions|differentiable]], suppose that $f^{-1}$ is also differentiable. Let $f:I\mapsto\Re$ be continuous on the interval $I$ and differentiable at $d$. Assume that $f$ has an inverse function $f^{-1}$ where $f'(d)\neq0$. We then propose that $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at $c=f(d)$ with:$$\Huge (f^{-1})'(c)=\frac{1}{f'(f(c))}$$To prove this, write $g=f^{-1}$. We show for every sequence $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ with $\lim_{n\to\infty}y_n=c$ we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{g(y_n)-g(c)}{y_n-c}=\frac{1}{f'(g(c))}$. Let $x_n=g(y_n)$, since $g$ is continuous we have that $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=$
