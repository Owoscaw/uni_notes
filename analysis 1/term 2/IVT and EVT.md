Let $a,b\in\Re$ with $a<b$ and $f:[a,b]\mapsto\Re$ be a [[Continuity|continuous]] function. If $f(a)<f(b)$ and $d\in[f(a),f(b)]$ then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ with $f(c)=d$. Similarly, if $f(a)>f(b)$ and $d\in[f(b),f(a)]$ then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ with $f(c)=d$. Proof:![[IVT proof]]
If $f:X\mapsto\Re$ is continuous and $X$ is an interval and for $a,b\in X$ with $a<b$, then restrict $f$ to a function acting on the interval $[a,b]$, then the IVT shows that all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are attained. So the image of $f$ becomes itself an interval. That is to say for an interval $I$, $f:I\mapsto\Re$, then the image under $f$, $f(I)$ is also an interval.
