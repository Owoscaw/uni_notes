Let $a,b\in\Re$ with $a<b$ and $f:[a,b]\mapsto\Re$ be a [[Continuity|continuous]] function. If $f(a)<f(b)$ and $d\in[f(a),f(b)]$ then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ with $f(c)=d$. Similarly, if $f(a)>f(b)$ and $d\in[f(b),f(a)]$ then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ with $f(c)=d$. Proof:![[IVT proof]]
If $f:X\mapsto\Re$ is continuous and $X$ is an interval and for $a,b\in X$ with $a<b$, then restrict $f$ to a function acting on the interval $[a,b]$, then the IVT shows that all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are attained. So the image of $f$ becomes itself an interval. That is to say[[]] for an interval $I$, $f:I\mapsto\Re$, then the image under $f$, $f(I)$ is also an interval. 

# Extreme value theorem:

Let $a,b\in\Re$ with $a<b$ and $f:[a,b]\mapsto\Re$ be a continuous function. Then by the above corollary we have that $f([a,b])=[c,d]$ for some $c,d\in\Re$ with $c\leq d$. In particular, $\exists u,v\in[a,b]$ with $f(u)=c,f(v)=d$. So every continuous function on a closed interval attains its minimum and maximum, and the continuous image of a closed interval is a closed interval:![[EVT proof]]
# Uniform continuity:

Let $f:X\mapsto\Re$ be a function with $X\subset\Re$. $f$ is uniform continuous if for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta$ such that for all $x,c\in X$ we have $|f(x)-f(c)|$ whenever $|x-c|<\delta$. Now $\delta$ depends only on $\epsilon$, not $c$. This is no longer a local property, and uniform continuity implies continuity.

Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then we propose that $f$ is uniform continuous. To prove this, we assume that $f$ is not uniform continuous. Take the negation of the above statement: $$\tiny(\forall\epsilon>0,\,\exists\delta>0:\forall c,x\in X:|f(x)-f(c)|<\epsilon \text{ whenever }|x-c|<\delta)^{'}=\exists\epsilon>0,\,\forall\delta>0:\exists x,c\in[a,b]:|x-c<\delta|\text{ and }|f(x)-f(c)|\geq\epsilon$$Take such $\epsilon>0$ and let $\delta_n=\frac{1}{n}$ for $n\in\mathbb N$. Now $\exists x_n,c_n\in[a,b]$ with $|x_n-c_n|<\frac{1}{n}$ and $|f(x_n)-f(c_n)|\geq\epsilon$. By [[Sequences#The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem|Bolzano-Weierstrass]] there exists a sequence $(x_{n_j})_{j\in\mathbb N}$ convergent to $x^*\in[a,b]$. Then also $c_{n_j}\to x^*$ as $j\to\infty$. Given $\epsilon^\prime>0$ there exists $N$ with $|x_{n_j}-x^*|<\frac{\epsilon^\prime}{2}$ for all $n_j\geq N$. Then for all $n_j>\max\{N,\frac{2}{\epsilon^\prime}\}$. For all such $n_j$, $|c_{n_j}-x^*|\leq|c_{n_j}-x_{n_j}|+|x_{n_j}-x^*|<\frac{1}{n_j}+\frac{\epsilon^\prime}{2}<\epsilon^\prime$. So we have $|c_{n_j}-x^*|<\epsilon^\prime\implies\lim_{j\to\infty}c_{n_j}=x^*$. 
By continuity of the function at $x^*$, there exists $\delta>0$ with $|f(x^*)-f(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ with $|x^*-x|<\delta$. For sufficiently large $n_j$ we have $|x_{n_j}-x^*|<\delta$ and $|c_{n_j}-x^*|<\delta$.

Now $|f(x_{n_j})-f(x_{n_j})|\leq|f(x_{n_j})-f(x^*)|+|f(x^*)-f(c_{n_j})|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=2$. So $|f(x_{n_j})-f(c_{n_j})|<\epsilon$, contradicting the statement $|f(x)-f(c)|\geq\epsilon$. Therefore by contradiction we conclude that $f$ must be uniform continuous.
