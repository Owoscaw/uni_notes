# Step function:

A function on a closed interval $[a,b]$ is called a step function if there exists a partition:$$\Huge a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$$of $[a,b]$ such that $f$ is constant on each subinterval $(x_k,x_{k+1})$ for $k=0,\dots,N-1$. Note each $f(x_k)$ is arbitrary in value. We then immediatley get the following properties:
