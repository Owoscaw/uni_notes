# Step functions:

A function on a closed interval $[a,b]$ is called a step function if there exists a partition:$$\Huge a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$$of $[a,b]$ such that $f$ is constant on each subinterval $(x_k,x_{k+1})$ for $k=0,\dots,N-1$. Note each $f(x_k)$ is arbitrary in value. We then immediately get the following properties:
> Let $f,g$ be two step functions on $[a,b]$ and $c\in\Re$, then $cf$ and $f+g$ are also step functions. Therefore step functions form a vector space
> The product $fg(x)=f(x)g(x)$ is also a step function
> The absolute value $|f|(x)=|f(x)|$ is also a step function

Let $f$ be a function on a closed interval $[a,b]$. $f$ is a regulated function if there exists a sequence of step functions $f_n$ converging [[Sequences of functions, uniform convergence, and Limit theorems#Uniform convergence preserves continuity|uniformly]] to $f$. That is for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N\in \mathbb{N}:|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x\in[a,b]$ and $n\geq N$.

Let $f$ be a function on a compact interval $[a,b]$. Then $f$ is regulated if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists a step function $g$ on $[a,b]$ such that $|f(x)-g(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. Assume that $f$ is regulated, then there is a sequence $(g_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of step functions converging uniformly to $f$. Given $\epsilon>0$ then there is $N$ that satisfies the definition for a regulated function, taking $g=g_n$. So we get the forwards implication. For $n\in \mathbb{N}$ take $\epsilon=\frac{1}{n}$, and take $g_n=g$ where $g$ satisfies $|f(x)-g(x)|<\epsilon$. Given $\epsilon>0$ take $N$ with $\frac{1}{N}<\epsilon$. Then for $n\geq N$ we have $\frac{1}{n}\leq \frac{1}{N}<\epsilon$ and we get the statement as required.

## Continuous functions are regulated:
Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$. Then $f$ is regulated. Since $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, it is uniformly continuous on the same interval. For all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x,y\in[a,b]$ we have that $|x-y|<\delta\implies|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. So take $\epsilon>0$ and use $\delta>0$ from uniform continuity and let $a=x_0<x_1,\dots<x_{N-1}<x_N=b$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with $x_{k+1}-x_k<\delta$. Take $x^*_k=(x_k,x_{k+1})$ and define $g(x)=f(x_k^*)$ for $x\in[x_k,x_{k+1})$ such that $g$ is a step function. We need to show $|g(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. Fix $x\in[a,b]$, if $x=n$ then $|g(b)-f(b)|=0<\epsilon$, otherwise $x\in[x_k,x_{k+1})$ for some $k$. Now $|g(x)-f(x)|=|f(x_k^*)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ since $|x_k^*-x|<\delta$ as they are both in the same interval and $x_{k-1}-x_k<\delta$. We then get that $f$ is regulated.

## Lipschitz continuous functions are regulated:
Assume $f:[a,b]\mapsto\Re$ is is lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constant $M$, that is $|f(x)-f(y)|\leq M|x-y|$ for all $x,y\in[a,b]$. Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Consider the equidistant partition $a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_{n-1}<x_n=b$ given by $x_k=a+(b-a)\frac{k}{n}$. Then $x_{k+1}-x_k=a+(b-a)\frac{k+1}{n}-a-(b-a)\frac{k}{n}=\frac{b-a}{n}$. We then define $$\Huge f_n(x)=\begin{cases}f(x_k^*)&\text{if }x\in[x_k,x_{k+1})\\f(x_{k-1}^*)&\text{if }x=b\end{cases}$$Where $x_k^*\in[x_k,x_{k+1})$. Note that if $x\in[x_k,x_{k+1})$ then $|f(x)-f_n(x)|=|f(x)-f(x_k^*)|\leq M|x-x_k^*|<\frac{b-a}{n}M$. Given $\epsilon>0$ choose $N\geq\frac{b-a}{\epsilon} M$, then for $n\geq N$ we have that $\frac{1}{n}\leq\frac{\epsilon}{(b-a)M}$. Therefore all lipschitz continuous functions are regulated.

## Some discontinuos functions are regulated:
Some piecewise continuous functions satisfy the definition of a regular function, a few of them are as follows:
> Heaviside functions:$$\Huge H(x)=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }x<0\\1&\text{if }x\geq0\end{cases}$$Dirac delta function:$$\Huge \delta(x)=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }x\neq0\\1&\text{if }x=0\end{cases}$$

## Regulated functions can have infinitely many discontinuities:
Let $(a_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ be a convergent sequence with $a_k\to a\in\Re$ as $k\to \infty$. Define $f:[0,1]\mapsto\Re$ by $f(x)=a_k$ if $x\in\left(\frac{1}{k+1},\frac{1}{k}\right]$ and $f(0)=a$. We propose that despite having infinitely many discontinuities between each $x=a_k$, $f$ is still a regulated function. Define:$$\Huge f_n(x)=\begin{cases}f(x)&\text{if }x\geq \frac{1}{n}\\a&\text{if }x\in\left[0,\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{cases}$$Then looking at the difference:$$\Huge |f_n(x)-f(x)|=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }x\geq\frac{1}{n}\\|a-a_k|&\text{if }x\in\left(\frac{1}{k+1},\frac{1}{k}\right]\end{cases}$$Given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N:|a-a_k|<\epsilon$ for all $k\geq N$. Then $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $n\geq N$ and $x\in[0,1]$, giving uniform convergence to $f$. Therefore $f$ is a regulated function despite it's infinitely many discontinuities.

## Monotone functions are regulated:
Let $f$ be a monotone function on $[a,b]$. Then $f$ is regulated. Assume $f$ is monotonically increasing, then $M=f(b)$ is the maximum of $f$ and $m=f(a)$ is the minimum of $f$. Let $y_k=m+k\frac{M-m}{n}$ for $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $k=0,\dots,n$, note that $y_0=m$ and $y_n=M$. For the partition points use $x_k=\sup\{x\in[a,b]:f(x)<y_k\}$. On the interval $[x_k,x_{k+1})$ we have $f(x)\in[y_k,y_{k+1})$. Define the step function $f_n$ with partition $x_0<x_1<\dots<x_n$ such that $f_n(x)=y_k^*$ for $x\in[x_k,x_{k+1})$ and $y_k^*\$
