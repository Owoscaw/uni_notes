# Convergence of functions:

Let $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of functions $f_n:I\mapsto\Re$ for some interval $I$. This sequence has a pointwise limit if for all $x\in I$, the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$ exists. We can describe this formally as follows. For all $x\in I$ and all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\geq N$, we have that $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$.
