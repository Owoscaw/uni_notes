Statements can either be true or false, and they must state something. Statements can be ruled true or false based off of axioms that we define ourselves.

Given that $A$ and $B$ are statements:
> $A\,\,and\,\,B$ is a statement that is true when both statements are true.
> $A\,\,or\,\,B$ is a statement that is true when either statement is true.
> $not\,\,\,A$ is a statement that is true when $A$ is false, and false when $A$ is true.

All of these statements are new statements that have been derived from other statements, $A$ and $B$. Often, we need to write that if $A$ is true, $B$ is true. This is written as $A\implies B$. The new statement $A\implies B$ is only false when $A$ is true and $B$ is not true.

This can be shown by considering two statements:
$$\Huge A:\,\,a=b\,,\,\,\,B:a^2=b^2$$
$B$ can be true when $A$ is false, i.e. $1^2=(-1)^2$, but the whole statement is true when $A$ is true. Whenever $A$ is true, $a$ will equal $b$, so $a^2=b^2$. In this case, $B$ is true whenever $A$ is true, so:
$$\Huge A\implies B$$
If $A$ and $B$ are statements
