Statements can either be true or false, and they must state something. Statements can be ruled true or false based off of axioms that we define ourselves.

Given that $A$ and $B$ are statements:
> $A\,\,and\,\,B$ is a statement that is true when both statements are true.
> $A\,\,or\,\,B$ is a statement that is true when either statement is true.
> $not\,\,\,A$ is a statement that is true when $A$ is false, and false when $A$ is true.

All of these statements are new statements that have been derived from other statements, $A$ and $B$. Often, we need to write that if $A$ is true, $B$ is true. This is written as $A\implies B$. The new statement $A\implies B$ is only false when $A$ is true and $B$ is not true.

This can be shown by considering two statements:
$$\Huge A:\,\,a=b\,,\,\,\,B:a^2=b^2$$
$B$ can be true when $A$ is false, i.e. $1^2=(-1)^2$, but the whole statement is true when $A$ is true. Whenever $A$ is true, $a$ will equal $b$, so $a^2=b^2$. In this case, $B$ is true whenever $A$ is true, so:
$$\Huge A\implies B$$
If $A$ and $B$ are statements, $A$ is logically equivalent to $B$ when both $A$ implies $B$ and $B$ implies $A$:
$$\Huge A\implies B,\,\,B\implies A,\,\,A\iff B$$

# Conditional statements:

Often, statements will depend on a variable, $x$. This is to say that a conditional statement's truth depends on $x$:
$$\Huge A(x)$$
$A(x)$ is true for some $x$ and false for other $x$. A conditional statement can become a statement by using the quantifiers "for all" and "there exists", $\forall$ and $\exists$.

# Sets:

Sets are a way to sort objects and incorporate them into mathematical statements. A set $X$ is a collection of objects. We write $a\in X$ if $a$ is an object that is described in $X$. We write $a\notin X$ if the object $a$ is not included in the set $X$. A set consisting of objects $x$ for which $A(x)$ is true is described as:
$$\Huge X=\left\{x:A(x)\right\}$$
In a set, the order of elements and how many times a single element appears does not matter
