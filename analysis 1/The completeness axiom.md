Let $X\subset \Re$. We say $X$ is bounded above if there exists a set $C\in\Re$ with $x\leq C$ for all $x\in X$. Here, $C$ is an upper bound for $X$. $X$ is bounded below is there exists a set $c\in\Re$ with $x\geq c$ for all $x\in X$. Here, $c$ is a lower bound for $X$.

The set $X$ is bounded if it is both bounded above and below.
