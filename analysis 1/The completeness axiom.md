Let $X\subset \Re$. We say $X$ is bounded above if there exists $C\in\Re$ with $x\leq C$ for all $x\in X$. Here, $C$ is an upper bound for $X$. $X$ is bounded below is there exists a set $c\in\Re$ with $x\geq c$ for all $x\in X$. Here, $c$ is a lower bound for $X$. The set $X$ is bounded if it is both bounded above and below.

For example, take $X=\mathbb{N}$. $1$ is a lower bound for $\mathbb{N}$ as $1\leq n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. An upper bound for $$
