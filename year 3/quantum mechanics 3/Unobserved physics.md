# Young's Slits:

Young's double slit experiment is the go-to example when explaining quantum mechanics in layman's terms, the setup is as follows:![[Unobserved physics 2025-10-07 20.48.00.excalidraw]]
For the particle source, we can find the probability distribution at the screen by calling $P_1(x)$ the distribution when one of the slits is blocked, and $P_2(x)$ the distribution when the other slit is blocked. The total distribution of particles at the screen is then $P=1/2(P_1+P_2)$. Note that for physical particles, we can add detectors (i.e. a sheet of paper with bullets passing through) without changing the distribution at the screen. This is the notion of completeness.

For the electron/photon source, experiments show an interference pattern only seen with waves:
