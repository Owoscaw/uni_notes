# Young's Slits:

Young's double slit experiment is the go-to example when explaining quantum mechanics in layman's terms, the setup is as follows:![[Unobserved physics 2025-10-07 20.48.00.excalidraw]]
For the particle source, we can find the probability distribution at the screen by calling $P_1(x)$ the distribution when one of the slits is blocked, and $P_2(x)$ the distribution when the other slit is blocked. The total distribution of particles at the screen is then $P=1/2(P_1+P_2)$. Note that for physical particles, we can add detectors (i.e. a sheet of paper with bullets passing through) without changing the distribution at the screen. This is the notion of completeness.

For the electron/photon source, experiments show an interference pattern only seen with waves:

Plotting the intensity of the waves at the screen can be done by calling the amplitude of oscillation $\psi(x)$, making the intensity $P=|\psi|^2$. This is a measure of the energy transmitted by the wave. Performing the same procedure for particles, we can find the intensity of waves emanating from each slit by writing $P_1=|\psi_1|^2,P_2=|\psi_2|^2$. Now as amplitudes add, not intensities, when considering waves, we find that $\psi=1/\sqrt{2}(\psi_1+\psi_2)$, making the final intensity $P_\text{wave}(x)=1/2|\psi_1(x)+\psi_2(x)|^2$, exactly the pattern in the diagram. Note that when measuring electrons using a Geiger counter, we get the same interference pattern as any physical particle would make, suggesting the nature of the electrons differs based on observation.

This leads to the conclusion that electrons travel as waves when not observed, despite them being observed as particles.
