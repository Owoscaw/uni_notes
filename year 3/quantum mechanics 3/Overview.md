Quantum mechanics describe an alternative model of the universe at the most fundamental level. These notes will give an understanding as to why quantum theory is required, as well as its formalism. The following will be discussed:
> Problems with Classical Physics
> Waves and the Schrodinger Equation
> Formal Quantum Theory
> First dimension applications
> Angular Momentum
> The hydrogen atom
> Symmetry, Antisymmetry, and the Exclusion Principle
> Conceptual issues
> Approximation methods
