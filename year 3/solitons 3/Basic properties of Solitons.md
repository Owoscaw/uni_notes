# The KdV equation:

# Soliton properties:

From the KdV equation with initial state $u(x,t=0)=\frac{N(N+1)}{\cosh^2(x)}$ we see that if $N$ is an integer, $N$ solitons are initially released. If $N$ is not an integer, some solitons disperse over time. More generally:
> Soliton speed is proportional to its height
> Shapes are preserved when solitons pass over each other

We can now refine the idea of a soliton. A soliton is a solution of a wave equation [[Introduction to PDEs#The vibration of a string|PDE]] that exhibits the following behavior:
> Localised (lump of energy)
> Localised form preserved over time
> Form is preserved under interaction with other solitons

Note that not all nonlinear PDEs have such solutions, however those that do are called integrable.
