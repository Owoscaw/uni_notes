Solitons are special solutions of special nonlinear wave equations with unusual properties, they are localised, move at constant velocity, and shape preserving (even in collision with other solitons). We will discuss:
> Waves, Dispersion, and Dissipation
> Travelling waves
> Topological lumps and the Bogomol'nyi bound
> Conservation laws
> The Backlund transform
> The Hirota method
