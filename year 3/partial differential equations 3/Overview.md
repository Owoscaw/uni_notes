The study of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) involves identifying their conservation laws, classifications, as well as finding solutions. These notes will discuss:
> First order equations
> Systems of first order equations
> Hyperbolic systems
> Classification of second order PDEs
> Poisson, Laplace, Heat, and Wave equations
