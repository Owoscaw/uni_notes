The aim of fluid dynamics is to provide a mathematical description of fluid flow and other continuous media. This module builds on the ideas of the [[Lagrangians for classical mechanics|Lagrangian]] and the [[Calculus of variations#Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange equations]] applied to fluids. The ideas of the velocity field, streamlines, and stream functions are introduced, as well as the concept of compressibility. These concepts extend to the notions of:
> Dynamics of ideal fluids
> Water waves
> Compressible flow
> Hydrodynamic stability
> Dynamics of viscous fluids
