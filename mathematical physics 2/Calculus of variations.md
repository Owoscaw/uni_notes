The [[Differentiable Functions#Differentiable results|extrema]] of a function, $\rho(s):\Re\to\Re$, at the point $s=s_0$ can be found when:$$\Huge \left.\frac{d\rho(s)}{ds}\right|_{s=s_0}=0$$An alternative but equivalent formulation of this:$$\Huge \rho(s+\delta s)=\rho(\delta s)+(\delta s)\frac{d\rho(s)}{ds}+R(s,\delta s)$$This comes from the [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of the function $\rho(s)$, where $\delta s$ is a small change in $s$, and $R(s,\delta s)$ is some error term. It is convienient to define:$$\Huge \delta\rho(s):=\rho(s+\delta s)-\rho(s)$$We then get:$$\Huge \delta\rho(s)=(\delta s)\frac{d\rho(s)}{ds}+R(s,\delta s)$$Note that by the definition of the derivative we get:$$\Huge \lim_{\delta s\to 0}R(s,\delta s)=\lim_{\delta s\to 0}\left[\rho(\delta s+s)-\rho(s)-(\delta s)\frac{d\rho(s)}{ds}\right]$$Now by the limit definition of $\frac{d\rho(s)}{ds}$, we have:$$\Huge \lim_{\delta s\to 0}\frac{R(s,\delta s)}{\delta s}=\lim_{\delta s\to0}\left[\frac{\delta\rho(s)}{\delta s}-\frac{d\rho(s)}{ds}\right]=0$$Which follows since the two terms on the right become equivalent in the infantesimal limit. Assuming $R(s,\delta s)$ has a regular Taylor expansion on $\delta s$, we get that:$$\Huge R(s,\delta s)=r_2(\delta s)^2+r_3(\delta s)^3+\dots$$We see that $R(s,\delta s)$ is of at least quadratic order, we denote this by saying:$$\Huge R(s,\delta s)=\mathcal{O}((\delta s)^2)$$Therefore we deduce that $\rho(s)$ has an extremum when:$$\Huge \delta\rho(s)=\mathcal{O}((\delta s)^2)$$
Generalising to a function, $\rho:\Re^n\mapsto\Re$, of $n$ variables, we have:$$\Huge \rho(s_1+\delta s_1,\dots,s_n+\delta s_n)=\rho(s_1,\dots,s_n)+\sum_{i=1}^n\delta s_i\frac{\partial\rho(s_i)}{\partial s_i}+\mathcal{O}((\delta s)^2)$$Stationary points of $\rho$ are therefore located where $\frac{\partial\rho(s_i)}{\partial s_i}$ for all $i$, that is to say $\delta\rho=\mathcal{O}((\delta s)^2)$.
