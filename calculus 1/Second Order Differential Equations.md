# Linear constant coefficient ODEs:

The general form of a second order constant coefficient linear ODE is:$$\Huge \alpha_2y''+\alpha_1y'+\alpha_0=\phi(x)$$
Where $\alpha_2\neq0$, $\alpha_1,\alpha_0$ are constants, and $\phi(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$. If $\phi(x)=0$, then the ODE is homogeneous. If this has two solutions $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$, then so is the arbitrary linear combination:$$\Huge y(x)=Ay_1(x)+By_2(x)$$
This is because:$$\Huge \alpha_2y''+\alpha_1y'+\alpha_0=\alpha_2(Ay''+By'')+\alpha_1(Ay'+By')+(Ay+Byh)$$
