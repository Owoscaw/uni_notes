# Linear constant coefficient ODEs:

The general form of a second order constant coefficient linear ODE is:$$\Huge \alpha_2y''+\alpha_1y'+\alpha_0=\phi(x)$$
Where $\alpha_2\neq0$, $\alpha_1,\alpha_0$ are constants, and $\phi(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$. If $\phi(x)=0$, then the ODE is homogeneous.
