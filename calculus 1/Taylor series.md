# Taylor's theorem:

Taylor's theorem states that if a $f(x)$ has $n+1$ continuous [[Derivative as a limit#Differentiability|derivatives]] in an open interval $I$, containing the point $x=a$, then $\forall x$ in that interval:$$\Huge f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k+R_n(x)$$
Where:$$\Huge R_n(x)=\frac{1}{n!}\int_a^x(x-t)^nf^{(n+1)}(t)dt$$
$R_n$ is known as the remainder. Proof:
