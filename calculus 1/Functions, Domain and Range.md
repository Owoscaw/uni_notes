A function $f$ is defined to be a correspondence between two sets, the domain $D$ and the codomain $C$. Each element of $D$ is assigned to one and only one element in $C$. If this is not satisfied, then the mapping is not a function.

When $x\in D$, $f(x)$ is used to denote the assigned element in $C$. This is the value of $f$ for the input $x$, otherwise known as the image of $x$ under the function $f$:
$$\Huge f:D\mapsto C:x\mapsto f(x)$$$$\Huge \forall x\in D,\,\,f(x)\in C$$
The range of $f$ is the collection of all images produced by its mapping. That is to say:
$$\Huge Ran\,\,f=\left\{f(x):x\in D\right\}$$
$$\Huge Ran\,\,f\subseteq Codom\,\,f$$

The graph of a function is the set of all ordered pairs, $(x,y)\in\Re^2:x\in\,Dom$
