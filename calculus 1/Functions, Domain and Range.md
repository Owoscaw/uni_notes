A function $f$ is defined to be a correspondence between two sets, the domain $D$ and the codomain $C$. Each element of $D$ is assigned to one and only one element in $C$. If this is not satisfied, then the mapping is not a function.

When $x\in D$, $f(x)$ is used to denote the assigned element in $C$. This is the value of $f$ for the input $x$, otherwise known as the image of $x$ under the function $f$:
$$\Huge f:D\impli$$
