A function $f$ is defined to be a correspondence between two sets, the domain $D$ and the codomain $C$. Each element of $D$ is assigned to one and only one element in $C$. If this is not satisfied, then the mapping is not a function.

When $x\in D$, $f(x)$ is used to denote the assigned element in $C$. This is the value of $f$ for the input $x$, otherwise known as the image of $x$ under the function $f$:
$$\Huge f:D\mapsto C:x\mapsto f(x)$$$$\Huge \forall x\in D,\,\,f(x)\in C$$
The range of $f$ is the collection of all images produced by its mapping. That is to say:
$$\Huge Ran\,\,f=\left\{f(x):x\in D\right\}$$
$$\Huge Ran\,\,f\subseteq Codom\,\,f$$

# Graphs:

The graph of a function is the set of all ordered pairs, $(x,y)\in\Re^2:x\in\,Dom\,\,f$, $y=f(x)$. Domains are often restricted to an interval $[a,b]$, so that they can be sketched. When necessary, a shaded circle is used to represent a point included in the set, while an open circle is used to represent a point excluded from the set.

# Even and Odd functions:

A function is even if:
$$\Huge f(x)=f(-x)\,\,\forall x\in Dom\,\,f$$
A function is odd if:
$$\Huge f(x)=-f(-x)\,\,\forall x\in Dom\,\,f$$
Every function can be written of its odd and even parts, that is:
$$\Huge f(x)=f_{even}(x)+f_{odd}(x)$$
