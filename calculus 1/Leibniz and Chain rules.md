# Leibniz rule:

If $f,g$ are both [[Derivative as a limit#Differentiability|differentiable]] $n$ times, then $fg(x)$ is also differentiable $n$ times. We have:$$\Huge D(fg)=(Df)g+f(DG)$$
$$\Huge D^2(fg)=(D^2f)g+2(Df)(Dg)+f(D^2g)$$
This is following the [[Combinations#Pascals triangle and Binomial theorem|binomial]] coefficients. This leads to the definition of the general Leibniz rule:
$$\Huge D^n(fg)=\sum_{k=0}^n\begin{pmatrix}n\\k\end{pmatrix}(D^kf)(D^{n-k}g)$$
