The derivative $f^{\prime}(a)$ of a function $f(x)$ at the points $a$ is equal to the slope of the tangent to the graph of $f$ at $x=a$, if it exists. This is naturally defined as the limit of the slope of a line segment joining two nearby points, $a$ and $a+h$, on the graph:![[graphic derivative as a limit]]
That is, a function is differentiable at a point $a$ if the following limit exists:
$$\Huge f^{\prime}(a)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$
If this limit exists $\forall a\in Dom\,f$, we say that $f$ is differentiable. If $f$ is differentiable, then $f^{\prime}(x)$ is a function called the derivative of $f(x)$.
