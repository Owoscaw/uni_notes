## Indefinite and definite integrals:

### Indefinite:

A function $F(x)$ is called an indefinite integral or anti[[Derivative as a limit|derivative]] of a function $f(x)$ in the interval $(a,b)$ if $F(x)$ is differentiable on that interval with $F^\prime(x)=f(x)$, then we write $F(x)=\int f(x)dx$. If $F(x)$ is an indefinite integral, then so is $F(x)+c$ for any constant $c$, as this will satisfy $F^\prime(x)=f(x)$. If $F_1(x)$ and $F_2(x)$ are both indefinite integrals of $f(x)$, then $F_1(x)-F_2(x)=c$, for any constant $c$.

A function $f(x)$ is integrable in $(a,b)$ if it has an indefinite integral $F(x$) in $(a,b)$ that is [[Limits and Continuity#Continuity|continuous]] in $[a,b]$.

### Definite:

A definite integral of $f(x)$ gives the signed area under the curve of the graph of $f(x)$:
![[Integration .excalidraw]]
This area is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum, by splitting the area into rectangles:
