# Limits:

A function, $f$, has a limit, $L$, at a point $x=a$ if $f(x)$ is always close to $L$ whenever $x$ is close to $a$. More precisely, if there is an acceptable error $\epsilon \in\Re$, $\epsilon > 0$, between $f(x)$ and $L$, then the following is required:
$$\Huge |f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$
This is true for all $x$ on some interval around $x=a$ such that $x$ is "close" to $a$. More precisely, if there is a distance $\delta\in\Re$, $\delta >0$ between $x$ and $a$, then the following is required:
$$\Huge |x-a|<\delta$$
Combining the above requirements, a limit can be precisely defined:
$$\Huge \forall\,\epsilon>0\,\exists\,\delta>0:|f(x)-L|<\epsilon\,\,when\,\,$$
