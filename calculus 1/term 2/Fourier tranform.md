[[Fourier Series]] can be thought of as frequency analysis of periodic functions, while the Fourier tranform can be thought of as frequency analysis of non-periodic functions. The fourier series of a function with period $2\pi$ can be written as:$$\Huge f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty d_ne^{inx}$$In the fourier series, coefficients $a_n,b_n$ tell you how much angular frequence $n$ is in $f(x)$. One can write $R=\sqrt{a_n^2+b_n^2}$ and $\alpha=\tan^{-1}(\frac{a_n}{b_n})$, allowing the summand in the fourier series to be written as:$$\Huge a_n\cos(nx)+b_n\sin(nx)=R\sin(nx+\alpha)$$Large $n$ corresponts to high frequencies, corresponding to small wavelength and therefore finer detail in a fourier series. The Fourier series for a function $f(x)$ with period $2\pi M$ can be written as:$$\Huge f(x)=\frac{a_0}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\cos\left(\frac{nx}{M}\right)$$
