An $n$-th order linear differential equation can be written in the form:$$\Huge \frac{d^ny}{dy^n}+p_1(x)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dy^{n-1}}+p_2(x)\frac{d^{n-2}y}{dy^{n-2}}+\dots+p_{n-1}(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+p_n(x)y=c(x)$$If $c(x)=0$, then the equation is homogeneous, if not then it is inhomogeneous. Linearity constrains the dependent variable, $y$, such that only of it's derivatives can appear in each term, there is no such constraint for the independent variable, $x$.

# Principle of Superposition:

If $y_1(x),y_2(x)$ solve a linear homogeneous ODE, then $y=\alpha y_1+\beta y_2$ is also a solution for constants $\alpha,\beta\in\Re$. This can be easily proven by considering the linearity of the derivative.
