[[Continuity and differentiability for functions of two or more variables#Differentiability|Differentiability]] in one dimension is defined as:$$\Huge f(x)=f(x_0)+M(x-x_0)+R(x)$$Now we let $x=x_0+\delta x$:$$\Huge f(x_0+\delta x)=f(x_0)+M\delta x+R(x)$$$$\Huge \delta f=f(x_0+\delta x)-f(x_0)=M\delta x+R(x)\approx M\delta x=\frac{df}{dx}\delta x$$That is to say, for very small change in $x$, then $\delta f$ is roughly proportional to $\delta x$. Extending this to two variables, for a function $f(x,y)$ and letting $x=x_0+\delta x, y=y_0+\delta y$:$$\Huge f(x_0+\delta x,y_0+\delta y)=f(x_0,y_0)+M\delta x+N\delta y+R(x,y)$$$$\Huge \delta f=f(x_0+\delta x,y_0+\delta y)-f(x_0,y_0)=M\delta x+N\delta y+R(x,y)\approx M\delta x+N\delta y$$This implies that the slop depends on the direction of movement. Choosing $\delta y=0$:$$\Huge \delta f=M\delta x+R(x_0+\delta x,y_0)$$From this, divide through by $\delta x$ and take limits:$$\Huge \lim_{\delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x_0+\delta x,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\delta x}=M+\lim_{\delta x\to 0}\frac{R(x_0+\delta x,y_0)}{\delta x}=M$$This is by definition of differentiability, and is a property of $R(x,y)$. This is the definition of the partial derivative in the $x$ direction, the change in a function when only considering movement in the $x$ direction. We can then formally define:$$\Huge \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)=\lim_{\delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x_0+\delta x,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\delta x}$$The partial derivative wrt $y$ can be defined similarly:$$\Huge \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)=\lim_{\delta y\to 0}\frac{f(x_0,y_0+\delta y)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\delta y}$$Note that $$
