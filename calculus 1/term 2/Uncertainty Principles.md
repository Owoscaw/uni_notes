The position of a particle under quantum mechanics in one dimension is described by the function $\psi(x,t)$ that obeys the Schrodinger equation:$$\Huge i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi$$This is first order in time, so to solve the IVP we need $\psi(x,0)=\psi(x)$. Here, $|\psi(x)|^2$ is a probability density of being measured at $x$. $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\tilde\psi(p)$ is the probability density for being measured with momentum $p$, where $\tilde\psi$ is the [[Fourier transform]] of $\psi$. $\Delta x$ is the standard deviation of probability density given by $|\psi|^2$, similarly with $\Delta p$. Heisenberg tells us:$$\Huge \Delta p\Delta x\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}$$Note that since $|\psi|^2$ is a probability density, it must integrate to one:$$\Huge \int_{-\infty}^\infty|\psi(x)|^2dx=1$$And also $\frac{1}{2\pi}|\tilde\psi|^2$ is a probability density so:$$\Huge \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty|\tilde\psi(p)|dp=1$$Then we can also say without loss of generality that:$$\Huge E(x)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty x|\psi(x)|^2dx=0,\,\,E(p)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty p|\tilde \psi(p)|^2dp=0$$This leads to the results:$$\Huge (\Delta x)^2=E(x^2)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty|\tilde\psi(x)|^2x^2dx,\,\,(\Delta p)^2=E(p^2)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty|\tilde \psi(p)|^2p^2dp$$
