We saw [[Linear Differential Equations#Differential Operators|earlier]] that it is possible to expand a piecewise smooth function in terms of basis polynomials, namely the [[Linear Differential Equations#Legendre's equation|Legendre Polynomials]]:$$\Huge f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty b_iP_i(x)$$Where $\mathcal{L}_LP_i(x)=i(i+1)P_i(x)$. Legendre polynomials can be given explicitly by:$$\Huge P_i(x)=\frac{1}{2^ii!}\frac{d^i}{dx^i}(x^2-1)^i$$Similarly to [[Fourier Series]], we aim to express any function as a sum of other functions with certain coefficients, in our case $b_i$. Finding a formula for these coefficients leads to the following observations:

It is easy to find components of a vector when the basis is orthogonal. Take this as an example:![[easy vector components]]
The eigenvectors of a self-adjoint matrix are orthogonal. Letting $V$ be a vector space on which we define the [[Inner product spaces|Inner product]] $(f,g)$ for $f,g\in V$. A linear map on $V$, $\mathcal{L}$ is called self adjoint if:$$\Huge (\mathcal{L}f,g)=(f,\mathcal{L}g)$$For all $f,g\in V$. Let $v_1,v_2$ be two eigenfunctions of $\mathcal{L}$ such that $\mathcal{L}v_1=\lambda_1v_1$ and $\mathcal{L}v_2=\lambda_2v_2$ assuming $\lambda_1\neq \lambda_2$:$$\large (v_1,\mathcal{L}v_2)=(\mathcal{L}v_1,v_2)\implies(v_1,\lambda_2v_2)=(\lambda_1v_2,v_2)\implies \lambda_2(v_1,v_2)=\lambda_1(v_1,v_2)$$$$\Huge \implies(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)(v_1,v_2)=0\implies(v_1,v_2)=0$$Therefore any two eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of a self-adjoint matrix are orthogonal.

If we can find an inner product such that $\mathcal{L}_L$ is self-adjoint with respect to the inner product, then each $P_i(x)$ are eigenfunctions of $\mathcal{L}_L$ and by the above observations must be orthogonal to each other. We suppose that this inner product is:$$\Huge (f(x),g(x))=\int_{-1}^1f(x)g(x)dx$$The bounds on the integral come from the singular points for Legendre's equation. We can then show the following:$$ (f(x),\mathcal{L}_Lg(x))=\int_{-1}^1f(x)\frac{d}{dx}\left((x^2-1)\frac{dg}{dx}\right)dx=\left[f(x)(x^2-1)\frac{dg}{dx}-\int \frac{df}{dx}(x^2-1)\frac{dg}{dx}dx\right]_{-1}^1$$$$ (f(x),\mathcal{L}_Lg(x))=0-\int_{-1}^1\frac{df}{dx}(x^2-1)\frac{dg}{dx}dx=-\left[\frac{df}{dx}(x^2-1)g(x)-\int \frac{d}{dx}\left((x^2-1)\frac{df}{dx}\right)g(x)\right]_{-1}^1$$$$\Huge (f(x),\mathcal{L}_Lg(x))=0+\int_{-1}^1 \frac{d}{dx}\left((x^2-1)\frac{df}{dx}\right)g(x)=(\mathcal{L}_Lf(x),g(x))$$So we have that $\mathcal{L}_L$ is self-adjoint with respect to this inner product.
