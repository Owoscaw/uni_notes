The [[Linear Differential Equations#Principle of Superposition|principle of superposition]] holds when considering linear PDEs, so we restrict our focus to such linear PDEs. This allows our solution space to be a vector space, however in this case the vector space is infinite dimensional.

# Second order linear PDEs:

A second order linear PDE of two independent variables where $u(x,t)$ takes form:$$\Huge Au_{xx}+2Bu_{xt}+Cu_{tt}+Du_x+Eu_t+F_u=0$$$A,B,C,D,E,F$ can be arbitrary functions of $x,t$.
