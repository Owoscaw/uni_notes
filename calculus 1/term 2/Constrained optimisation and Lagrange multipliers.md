A common problem involves determining the maximum or minimum of some function $f(x,y)$ subject to a constraint $g(x,y)=0$. Example:![[rectangle example]]
# Method of Lagrange multipliers:

Find stationary points of $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=0$. When $g$ is in this form, $g=0$ is a level set, so $\underline\nabla g\cdot\underline{\hat n}=0$ where $\underline{\hat n}$ is the vector tangent to the path set out by $g$. At the maximum on this path, we know that $\underline\nabla f\cdot\underline{\hat n}=0$. Therefore we know that $\underline\nabla g,\underline\nabla f$ lie in the same direction at a [[Stationary points for multivariate functions#Distinguishing extrema|stationary point]] of $f$:$$\Huge \underline\nabla f=\lambda\underline\nabla g$$For some $\lambda\in\Re$. Construct the function $\phi=f-\lambda g$, then at the stationary point, $\underline\nabla \phi=\underline\nabla(f-\lambda g)=\underline\nabla f-\lambda\underline\nabla g=0$, therefore $\phi$ has an unconstrained stationary point. Then computing $\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}=0,\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y}=0$ and using the original constraint, $g(x,y)=0$, we have three unknowns and three equations to use.
