A common problem involves determining the maximum or minimum of some function $f(x,y)$ subject to a constraint $g(x,y)=0$. Example:![[rectangle example]]
# Method of Lagrange multipliers:

Find stationary points of $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=0$. When $g$ is in this form, $g=0$ is a level set, so $\underline\nabla g\cdot\underline{\hat n}=0$ where $\underline{\hat n}$ is the vector tangent to the path set out by $g$. At the maximum on this path, we know that $\underline\nabla f\cdot\$
