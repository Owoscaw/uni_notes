# Boundedness and Monotonicity:

## Bounds:

Let $f(x)$ be defined on an interval $I$. $f(x)$ is bounded from above in $I$ by an upper bound $k_1$ if $\exists k_1:f(x)\leq k_1\forall x\in I$. $f(x)$ need not take the value of $k_1$ over the interval $I$. If $\exists x_1\in I$ such that $f(x_1)=k_1$, then the upper bound has been attained, $k_1$ becomes the global maximum value of $f(x)$ in $I$.

Similarly, $f(x)$ is bounded from below in $I$ by a lower bound $k_2$ if $\exists k_2:f(x)\geq k_2\forall x\in I$. If $\exists x_2$ such that $f(x_2)=k_2$, then the lower bound has been attained, $k_2$ becomes the global minimum value of $f(x)$ in $I$.

Combining both definitions, $f(x)$ is bounded if it is bounded both above and below in $I$. That is if $\exists k$ such that $|f(x)|\leq k$. If no interval $I$ is specified, it should be taken that $I=Dom\,f$.
