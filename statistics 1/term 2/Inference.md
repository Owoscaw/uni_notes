Inference is drawing conclusions from facts, data, and premises.

# Sample mean as an estimator:

Assume there is a population of interest with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. A simple random sample of size $n$ is taken such that $n$ is sufficiently large to call successive samples independent. Label each such sample $X_1,\dots,X_n$. Before their values are seen, each $X_i$ is a random variable with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. We then define the sample mean:$$\Huge \bar X=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$This has the following properties:$$\Huge E[\bar X]=E\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\right]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nE[X_i]=\frac{1}{n}\times n\mu=\mu$$$$\Huge Var[\bar X]=Var\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\right]=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^nVar[X_i]=\frac{1}{n}\times n\sigma^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$This implies $\bar X$ is an [[Random sampling and proportions#Sample proportion as an estimator|unbiased estimator]] and that the variance of $\bar X$ is dependent on $n$. If the population of $X_i$ is normally distributed: $$\Huge X_i\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\implies\bar X\sim N\left(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)$$$\bar X$ is still random before all $X_i$ are measured. Once measured, $X_i$ becomes $x_i$ and $\bar X$ becomes $\bar x$.
