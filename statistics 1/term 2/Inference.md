Inference is drawing conclusions from facts, data, and premises.

# Sample mean as an estimator:

Assume there is a population of interest with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. A simple random sample of size $n$ is taken such that $n$ is sufficently large to call successive samples independent. Label each such sample $X_1,\dots,X_n$. Before their values are seen, each $X_i$ is a random variable with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. We then define the sample mean:$$\Huge \bar X=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$This has the following properties:$$\Huge E[\bar X]=E\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\right]=\frac{1}{n}E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n\right]$$
