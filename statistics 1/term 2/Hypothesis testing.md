Suppose we are interested in a single unkown parameter $\theta$, we suggest a number $r$ which we either beleive may be the value for $\theta$, or we want to compare $\theta$ to. We then define the null and alternative hypothesis. Construct two hypotheses:
>$H_0$, the null hypothesis, that $\theta=r$
>$H_a$, the alternative hypothesis denies the null hypothesis, the type of denial determines whether the hypothesis test is one sided or two sided

A two sided hypothesis test states:$$\Huge H_0:\theta=r,\,\,H_a:\theta \neq r$$A one sided test states:$$\Huge H_0:\theta=r,\,\,H_a:\begin{cases}\theta<r\\\theta>r\end{cases}$$
The big questions is, given a particular sample of data, should we reject the null hypothesis or not. For example, consider $\mu$ to be the mean of the population of cuckoo eggs. An ornithologist wishes to test the hypothesis $\mu=22.t$
