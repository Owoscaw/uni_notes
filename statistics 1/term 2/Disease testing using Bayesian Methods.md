A new test for covid-19 has been developed. It is fast and cheap but has moderate accuracy. This test was used on a sample people with known status of covid. Consider that you are selected at random from the UK population in August 2020 and you test positive. What is the probability that you have Covid?

The test was performed on $620$ hospital patients with known covid status by a gold-standard covid test:

|                     | Has Covid $D^+$ | Has not Covid $D^-$ | Total |
|:-------------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:-----:|
| Test Positive $T^+$ |      $209$      |         $6$         | $215$      |
| Test Negative $T^-$ | $11$                | $394$                    | $405$      |
|        Total        | $220$                | $400$                    | $620$      |
