Probability is a function that is applied to $\mathcal{F}$, the complete set of events in a [[Sample spaces and events|sample space]] $\Omega$ defined as:
$$\Huge \mathcal{F}=2^{\Omega}$$
That is, $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of every possible subset in $\Omega$, where each subset represents an event. Probability is a function that maps this set to a real number, let $A\in\mathcal{F}$ represent an event:
$$\Huge \mathbb{P}:\mathcal{F}\mapsto\Re,\,\,\mathbb{P}(A)\in\Re$$
