A sample space is a set of outcomes from a scenario, of which we know all the possible outcomes that could occur. The sample space for a scenario is such that one and only one outcome will occur. This is denoted as $\Omega$, and a generic outcome as $\omega$:
$$\Huge \omega\in\Omega$$
The elements of a sample space can be enumerated in a list, finite or infinite:
$$\Huge \Omega:=\left\{\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots\right\}$$
If this is possible, $\Omega$ is countable and discrete.

A set, $A$, is countable when it is finite, or can be mapped one-to-one to the set of natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$. That is to say for every natural number, there is an element in $A$ that corresponds to it.

# Events:

An event is a collection of possible outcomes from $\Omega$, so is also a subset of $\Omega$. 
$$\Huge \forall\Omega,\,\exists\,\,a\,\,set\,\,\mathcal{F}$$
Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all possible events from the sample space $\Omega$:
$$\Huge A\subseteq\Omega,\,\,A\in\mathcal{F}$$
$A$ is an event that happens when the outcome at the end of a scenario is in the set $A$. If $\Omega$ is discrete, then the statement:
$$\Huge \mathcal{F}=2^{\Omega}$$
