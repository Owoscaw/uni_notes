A sample space is a set of outcomes from a scenario, of which we know all the possible outcomes that could occur. The sample space for a scenario is such that one and only one outcome will occur. This is denoted as $\Omega$, and a generic outcome as $\omega$:
$$\Huge \omega\in\Omega$$
The elements of a sample space can be enumerated in a list, finite or infinite:
$$\Huge \Omega:=\left\{\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots\right\}$$
If this is possible, $\Omega$ is countable.

A set, $A$, is countable when it is finite, or can be mapped one-to-one to the set of natural numbers, $\Nat$
