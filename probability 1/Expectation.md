# Definition and interpretation:

When an experiment is repeated $n$ times, $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is the sample, then the sample mean is given by:$$\Huge \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$$
Intuitively, the limit of the sample mean as $n\to\infty$ should converge. This value is called the expectation of the experiment.

For any real valued [[Random variables|random variable]], $X$, the expectation denoted as $\mathbb{E}(X)$ is defined as:$$\Huge \mathbb{E}(X):=\begin{cases}\sum\limits_{x\in\mathcal{X}}x\,p(x)&\text{if}\,\,X\,\,\text{is discrete}\\\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty x\,f(x)dx&\text{if}\,\,X\,\,\text{is continuous}\end{cases}$$
