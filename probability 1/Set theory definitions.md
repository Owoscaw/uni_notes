A set is an unordered collection of objects. Any object can be a part of a set, even other sets. A set is defined in the following manner:
$$\Huge A:=\{elements\}$$
The outcomes of the set $A$ are called the elements of $A$. The empty set, $\emptyset$, is defined as the set with no elements:
$$\Huge \emptyset:=\{\}$$
For two sets, $A$ and $B$, if $A$ is a subset of $B$, the following is true:
$$\Huge A\subseteq B,\,\,\forall x\in A,\,\,x\in B$$
Every element in set $A$ is also in set $B$.

The power set of $A$ is a set consisting of all subsets of $A$, denoted as $2^A$:
$$\Huge 2^A:=\left\{B:B\subseteq A\right\}$$

# Set operations:

## Union:
The union operator represents the collection of sample points from two sets, $A$ and $B$:
$$\Huge A\cup B=\left\{\omega:\omega\in A\,\,or\,\,\omega\in B\right\}$$
## Intersect:
The intersect operator represents the collection of sample points that are in both sets $A$ and $B$:
$$\Huge A\cap B=\left\{\omega:\omega\in A\,\,and\,\,\omega\in B\right\}$$
## Complement:
The complement of a set is the collection of sample points that are not in a given set:
$$\Huge A$$
