A set is an unordered collection of objects. Any object can be a part of a set, even other sets. A set is defined in the following manner:
$$\Huge A:=\{elements\}$$
The outcomes of the set $A$ are called the elements of $A$. The empty set, $\emptyset$, is defined as the set with no elements:
$$\Huge \emptyset:=\{\}$$
For two sets, $A$ and $B$, if $A$ is a subset of $B$, the following is true:
$$\Huge A\subseteq B,\,\,\forall x\in A,\,\,x\in B$$
Every element in set $A$ is also in set $B$.

The power set of $A$ is a set consisting of all subsets of $A$, denoted as $2^A$
