A reliability network is a diagram of nodes and arcs. Each node represents a component of a multi component system. Each node is either working or not. The entire system works if it is possible to traverse the system while only passing through working nodes. Probability has applications here, with each node having a related [[Probability definition|probability]] if it is working or not.

Suppose that the $i$th component functions with a probability $p_i,i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ and different components are independent. The probability that a system overall works is equivalent to $p_1p_2\dots p_k$. This function is denoted as $r(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k)$, known as the reliability function. This is determined by the layout of the probability network.
