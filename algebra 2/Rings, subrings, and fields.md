Consider the integers, $\mathbb{Z}=\{0,\pm1,\pm2,...\}$. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication between any two integers always result in another integer. Consider the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$, addition and multiplication between any two natural numbers result in another natural number, however this does not hold for subtraction. Consider the rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}:a,b\in\mathbb{Z},b\neq0\}$, all elementary operations on two numbers in this set result in another rational number.

This motivates the definition of a ring. A ring is a set of mathematical objects where addition, subtraction, and multiplication is possible between any two elements in the set, where the result is another element in the set. We see that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are both rings. If division is possible
